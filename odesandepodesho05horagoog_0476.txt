Cureti. IV.

Lupis et agnis quanta sortito obtigit,
Tecum mihi discordia est,
Hibericis peruste funibus* latus,
Et crura dura compede.
Licet superbus ambules pecunia,
Fortuna non mutat genus.
Videsne, Sacram metiente te Viam†
Cum bis trium ulnarum toga,‡
Ut ora vertat huc et huc euntium
Liberrima indignatio ἔξ
“ Sectus flagellis hic triumviralibus
Praeeonis ad fastidiuml
Arat Falerni mille fundi jugera
Et Appiam mannis terit,

liberrima indignatio”

1 think with Macleane that this appears rather to mean the open indig-
nation which made the passengers turn their looks towards him, than
turn away in disgust, which is the construction os the scholiasta Yonge
suggests a totally different interpretation: “See how airee’' (t e.. un·
reserved, undisguised) “ seorn alters the countenance¹’ (ora vertat) ‘⁴ οἱ all
who pass along.”

ΙΙ The 'triumviri Capitales had the pomer oi inflicting summary chas-

tisement on slaves When the scourge was inflicted, a public crier stood
by and proclaimed the nature nithe crime.
