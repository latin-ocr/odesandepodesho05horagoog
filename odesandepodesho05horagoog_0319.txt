308 Tlte Odes of Horace.

(ἕο, and bid silver-tongued N eaera hasten,
' ¹ Binding in Spartan knot her locks myrrh·scented,⁸
But, is obs'tructed by that brute her porter,
Quietly come back

Nothing cools fiery spirits like a gray hair ς

In every quarrel 'tis your sure peacemaker;

In my hot youth, when Plancus was the consul,
I was less patient.†

*Myrrheum erinem.” The scholiasts interpreted this expression
“myrrh-colored,” Orelli and other recent commentatum support the
interpretation ⁴⁶ myrrh-scented” ·

1 Le„ when Horace was in his twenty-third year.
