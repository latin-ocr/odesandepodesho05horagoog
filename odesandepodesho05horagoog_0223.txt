, 212 T lte Odes of Horace.

Lands, home, and wile, ln whom thy soul dellghteth‚
Lest3 and one tree alone of all thy woodlands,
Loathed cypress, faithful found,
Shall follow to the last the brief-lived lord.

The worthier heir thy Caeeuban shall squander,
Bursting the hundred locks that guard its treasures,
And wines more rare than those ‘
Sipped at high feast by pontiffs,* dye thy floors.

* As the English say, “A dinner fit lor an alderman?⁸ 'so the Ro·
ἓξ {²³⁶¹ “A banquet fit lor a pontiw “Pontificum dapes, Saliares
