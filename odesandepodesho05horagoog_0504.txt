and apprehensions in common. If it be allowable to draw
a conjecture from the touching illustration of the fate of
Achilles, doomed in the land of Assaracus to a stormy life
and an early death, the poem might have been wn‘tten be-
tween the date of Horace’s departure into Asia Minor, in the

service of Brutus, and that of the trials and dangers which
’ closed at the field of Philippi, nuc. 7¹²· Ritter, indeed,
places its date in the interval between the death ol Cassius
and the battle of Philippi. lt may, however, be observed,
that il the invitation to the feastmaster to bring forth the
wine stored in the consulship of Torquatus is to be taken
literally, wine of that age could scarcely have been found in
the commissariat of Brutus. If not written while in the camp
of Brutus, it was probably composed between nuc. 712 auri
716, soon aller Horace‘s return to Rome, before the 'tornines
of his life, and perhaps his political views, were changed by
the favor ol Maecenas, and while his chief associates would
naturally have been among the remnants of the party with
whom he had fought, and to whose minds (if there be any
thing peculiarly appropriate in the reference to Achilles)
military dangers in a foreign land might still be the salient

apprehension. It is evidently written some years before ”

Ode ix. Lib. I. Horace here classes himself emphatically
with the young. In Ode in he addresses Thaliarchus, or ¹
the feastmaster, with the half-envious sentiment of a man
who points out the pleasures of youth to another—who yet
' sympathizes with those pleasures, but is somewhat receding
from them himself.

Canu. XIII.

Horrida tempestas caelum contraxit, et imbres
Nivesque deducunt Jovem ; nunc mare, nune siluae

Threicio Aquilone sonant: rapiamus, amici,¹
Occasionem de die,dumque virent genua,
Et decet, obducta solvatur fronte senectus*
