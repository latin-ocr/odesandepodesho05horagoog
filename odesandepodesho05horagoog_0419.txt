408 Tlre Odes of Horace.

ODE VI.

ΤΟ nouo,

This ode maybe considered the prooemium to the Secuiar ’
Hymn‚ nuc, 737, although evidently written aiter it As
that hymn celebrates Apollo and Diana, so this ode appro-
priateiy commences with an invocation to Apollo, whom

Horace invokes (line 27) to defend the dignity oi the
Roman

· God, in whom Niobe’s sed offspring felt
The stem chastiser os the vaunting tongue,

And Tityos vast, the ravisher‚-and he,
Phthian Achilles,

Almost the victor oi high Troy (to thee

Unequal, over other force supreme) ;

Though warring with dread spear the Sea-nymph's son
ί Shook Dardan tdwers,

As salisa pine beneath the biting steei,
· Or cypress wrenched by Eurus from its root,
He iell, and wide and far on Trojan dust
Stamped his great image

The salse horse, duping, in Minerva's name,

Lost Trojans mirthiul at their feast oi death,

With choral dances blithe in Priam's hall,
Hid not Achilles.

His prey, alas! he slew with open hand 3

His math, alas! had given to Argiue flames

The harmiess infants even within the womb‚
Smiting the unbom,

Had not the Father of the gods, subdued
By thee and Venus, with impioring prayer,
