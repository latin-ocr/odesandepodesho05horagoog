tion of the chime rendered sufficientiy familiar by Canning's
“Knife·grinder,'' not only because, in the mind of an Eng-

lish reader, it is associated witha popular burlesque, but
chiefly because an English imitation of the Latin rhythm,
with adue observation of the trochee in the first three lines
of the staura, has in itself an unpleasant and monotonous
sing-song. In my version of the Sapphic I have chiefly
employed two varieties of rhythm : for the statelier odes, our
own recognized blank verse in the first three lines, usually,
though not always, with a dissyllabic termination5 and, in
the fourth line, amatre analogous in length andcadence to '
the fourth line of the original, though, of course, without
any attempt at preserving the Latin quantity of dactyl and
spondee. In fact, as Dr. Kennedy has truly observed, the
spondeo is not attainable in our language, except by a very
forced effort of pronunciation. That which passos current
as an English spondae is really a trochee. For the lighter
odes of the Sapphic mette, a ruore sportive or tripping meas-
ure is adopted.

I must l'eave my versions of the other metres which

Horace has less frequently employed to speak for them- ’

selves.

In the Latin version, placed side by side with the Eng-
lish, I have generally adopted the text of Orelli. The rare
instances in which Ι have differed from it for that of another
editor are stated in the notes. For the current punctuation
-which in Orelli, and indeed in Macleane, is so sparse as
not unfrequcntly to render the sense obscure to those not
familiarly intimate with it-I am largely indebted to the
admirable edition of Mr. Yonge. The modes of spellingpre-
ferred by Ritter and Mr. Munro as more faithful transcripte
of the ancient MSS, involve questions of great interest to
professional scholare, but are as yet too unfamiliar to the
general reader for adoption in a text especially designed for
