374 T he Odes os Horace.

Pure from all taint let airs and dews ol heaven
Nourish the new-born lile.

Mild‚ all thine arrows sheathed within the quium,

Hear thy boy-supplianm, merciiul Apollo 3*

Hear thy girl-votaries, crescentcrowned Luna,
Queen of the clustered stars.

If Rome be your work-il beneath your saleguard

A band of wanderers, llion's scanty temnant,

Ordained to change their city and their Lares,
Have held this Tuscan land—

They, unto whom, through Troy that blazed unharming,
Pure-souled AEneas, his lost land’s survivor,
Opened free path, and heritage more ample

Than aught relinquished gave3

Gods, grant to docile youth worth's uprightmanners-

Gods, grant to placid age worth's calm contenhnent-

Grant to the Roman race growth, power, and riches,†
And all that can adom l

Bless him who nears with milk-white steers your altars,
Whose blood liows bright irom Venus and Anchises ;
Still every soe in battle may he conquer,

And alter conquest spare.

Awed by our armS, and by the Alban lictors,‡
Now the Mede owns our power on land and ocean;
Now Ind and Scythia, she of late so haughty,

To Rome ior pardon sue.§

¹ This line seems to reler to the new stante oi the Apollo oi Actium
set up by Augustus in the Palatine temple. ln the Apollo ol Actium
invoked by Augustus before his battle with hl. Antony, the bow is bent
-in the Apollo oi the Palatine the bow is laid aside ior the lyre and
plectrum-See Macleane’s excellent note on this line.
