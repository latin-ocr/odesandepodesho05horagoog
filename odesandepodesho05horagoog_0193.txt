182 T he Odes os Horace. ,

Ἦὴςῐε Jove bestows long springs and genial winters‚
And Aulon’s mount, friend to a fertile Bacchus,
Never has cause the purple of Falernian

Clusters to envy.

Both thee and me that place, those blessed hill-tops,
Invite3 thy tear shall there bedew the relies
Os thy lost poet-friend, while yet there lingers

Warmth in the ashes..
