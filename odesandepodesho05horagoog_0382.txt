The Secudzr Hymn. 371

recitative as “ludricrum” according to the custom of dra· s
matie aud lyric poets of Greece ; and (Lib. iv. Cann. vi.) the

young girls who take part in the choms are enjoined not f

only to preserve the Lesbian melre, in which the hymn was
composed, but to remember “pollicis ictum,'’ the beat of
his linger in marking time. ’

Regarded only as a poem, the Secular Hymn, though it
deserves higher praise than Macleane and other c‘ritics have
bestowed on it, can nothe said to equal the genius exhibited
in many of the odes, especially in Book 111. But if set—
whether by Horace himself, or by others whom he more or
less schooled and directed-to some music which became a
grand national air, such as “God save the King,’' or “The
Marseillaise,” we can readily account for the special pride
with which he refers to it, andrthe increased rank which it
appears to have won for him in popular estimation.

In the Secular Hymn, and in some of the Sapphic odes
of the Fourth Book, 'Horace more confonns than he does in
the first three books to the Greek usage, in the variation of
the caesura and the introduction of the trochee in the second
place. Ι have judgecl it necessary, for the solemnity of
feeling which is instilled into this poem, to add another foot
to the fourth line in the translation.
