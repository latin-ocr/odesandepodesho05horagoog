Book L-Ode XVII. ¹101

the reference to the jealous violence of Cyrus looks like an
allusion to some incident that had previously occurred. On
the one hand, nothing is more likely than that Horace
should have known, and invited to his villa, some such ac-
'complished freed-woman as is here addressed. On the
other hand, nothing is more consonant to his exquisite art
than the invention of attributes and incidents lor the pur-
pose οἱ giving the interest of reality to apurely imaginary

. creation. A compliment to the beauty ol the person ad-
dressed is insinuated by the name ol Tyndaris, “ as if,” says
Orelli, “she were another Helen.”

Caum. XVII.

Velox amoenum saepe Lucretilem
Mutat Lyoaeo Faunus, et igneam
· Defendit aestatem capellis
Usque meis pluviosque ventos.

Impune tutum per nemus arbutos
Quaerunt latentes et thyma deviae
Olentis uxores mariti 3
N ec virides metuunt colubras,

Nec Martiales Haediliae lupos,
Utcunque dulci, Tyndari, fistula
Valles et Usticae cubantis
Levia personuere saxa.

Di me tuentur, dis pietas mea
Et Musa cordi est Hic tibi copia
Manabit ad plenum benigno
Ruris honorum opulenta cornu.
