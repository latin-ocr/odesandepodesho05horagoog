, Book lIL—Ode l. 237

preters assume, addressed to the chorus of boys and girls
, surrounding the priests and singing the praises of the gods,
has also, according to the scholiasts, a much wider sig-
nificance, and isa special address to the rising generation.
“Horace‚'' says Macleane, “speaks as if he despaired ol
impressing his precepts on any but the young, and bids the
rest stand aside, as incapable ol being initiated in the true
wisdom of lile.” It is' not easy to assign an appropriate
heading to this ode. That which I select appears, on the·
whole, bettgp than any pther in use though not quite satis-
sactory. The whole ode, which ranks high among the
noblest attempts ol a poet to embody didactic purpose in
lyrical form, consists in a succession ol brilliant images or
pictures, seemingly detached, but constituting a moral
whole. rst, The solemn recognition of the supreme God

- triumphant over brute force (“ Clari Giganteo triumpho ”),

and governing the universe 3 zdly, The impartiality ol F ate,
and the certainty of death ς 3dly, The misery of the guilty
conscience· not to be soothed by sensual or artistic enjoy-
ments. Atrine 25, “Desiderantem quod satis est,'' the
main objectos the poem—viz, in the inculcation os that
wisdom os contentment by which Horace contrives to unite
Epicurean with Stoic philosophy—develops itself, and is
continued to the close.

Odi profanum vulgus et arceo ;
Favete linguis : carmina non prius
Audita Musarum sacerdos ἶ

Virginibus puerisque canto.

Regum timendorum in proprios gieges,
Reges in ipsos imperium est Jovis‚
Clari Giganteo triumpho,
Cuncta supercilio moventis*
