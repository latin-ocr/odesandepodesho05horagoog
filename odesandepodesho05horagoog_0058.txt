· lor his uncle's murder is in becoming the protector and father

ol his people. Against this praise it may be said, not with·
out reason, that the poem has blemishes of a kind t'rom which
Horace is free in odes ol similar importance 3 that there is
something forced and artificial in the kind os humor admitted
into the description os Pyrrha's flood3 that the idea os the
uxorious River bursting his banks out ol complaisance to the
complaints of his wile is little better than a frigid conceit3 and
that the ‘⁸ extravaganza'' contained in the transfigugation ol
Mercury into the earthly form of Augustus, tails in that man-
, liness of genuine enthusiasm with which Horace celebrates
Augustus in Odes B. 111. and 1v. Whatever weight may be
attached to these objections, they suffice to render the ode
one of the most difficult to translate so as to impress an Eng-
lish reader with some sense of the beauties ascribed to it by
its admirers.

Canu. II.

Jam satis terris nivis atque dirae

Grandinis misit Pater, et rubente

Dextera sacras jaculatus arces*
Terruit Urbem,

Terruit gentes, grave ne rediret

Saeculum Pyrrhae‚ nova monstra questae,

Omne cum Proteus pecus egit altos
Visere montes,

Piscium et summa genus haesit ulmo,

Nota quae sedes suerat columbis,

Et superjecto pavidae natarunt
AEquore† damae.

applied it afterwards to the latter (Cicero, head a). Though the word
here implica “vatem‘’ the point would be lost in so translating it. There
would be no prodigy in decr swimming through water-the prodigy is in
their swimming through plains cast over those on which they had been
accustomed to range.
