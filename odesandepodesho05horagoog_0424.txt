Book Ila-Ode VII. 413

Aulus Torquatus, οἰ whom Nepos speaks in his Lil'e ol
Atticus, e. 11, who had served with Brutus and Cassius
at Philippi, and was therefore Horace’s old sehon-soldier.
Macleane considers the poem to be one of Horace’s earlier
odes, and introduced to swell the fasciculus—or, as we
should say, fill up the volume. 1 do not see much cause
lor that supposition. The sentiment is one habitual to
Horace at every stage oi his lile, and it is in larmony with

the tone ol the epistle, published probably five or six years
before the Fourth Book ol Odes.
