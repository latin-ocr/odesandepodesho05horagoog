442 Τ he Odcs os Horace.

Thee the monster-fiaught ocean, which mars ·
Round the birth-place remote os the Briton ς

Thee fierce Gallia, the land sor which death has no tenor,
Thee Iberia, the stubbom, here hushed and submissive 3
The Sygambri, exulting in gore,
with meek arms piled in trophy, adore thee„
