EPODE X.

ΟΝ MAEVIUS smtwo 0111· ΟΝ Α vorholt.

The name 01 Maevius has become proverbially identified
with the ideal ol'a bad poet3 but, aster all, the justice 01
this very unpleasant immortality rests upon no satisfactory
evidence. virgil, with laconic disdain, dismisses him and
Bauius to obloquy‚ and this poem is a specimen 01 Horace’s
mode, in his hot youth, 01 treating a person to whom he
owed a grudge. But poets are very untrustworthy judges 01
the merits oia contemporary poet, whom, for some reason
or other, they dislike. Ir' nothing of Southey be left to re
mote posterity, and he is only then to be judged by what
Byron has said 01 him, Southey would appear a sort 01 Mae·
vius. On the other hand, what would Byron seem it' notb-
ing were lelt olbis works‚ and, one or two thousand years
hence, he were to be judged by the opinions 01 his verse
which Soutbey and Wordsworth and Coleridge have leit ⁵
on record? As to the severest things said 01 Maerius by

„- writers 01 alater generation, and who had probably never

read a line 01 him, they are but echoes 01 the old lam·
poons, “Give a dog a bad name,” etc. 11 it be true, as
the commentator in Cruquius says, that Maevius was “a de·
tractor 01 all learned men‚‘’ and a cultivator 01 archaisms,
or an elder school 01 expression, “sectator vocum antiqua·

amb„

Under ill-boding auspices puts forth the vessel

Which has Maevius-a rank-smelling cargo-on board;
Either side 01 that nessei, with surges the roughest,

Ο be miudsul, I pray thee, wild Auster, to scourge!
On an ocean upheaved from its inruost foundations,

May the dark irowning Eurus snap cables and oars3
