Bantia-ode X Vl. ²17

made a Roman citizen by Pompey, and took his name, which
descended to the Grosphus of the ode as son or grandson.
ln Epist. i. 12, Horace commends him to Iccius, then aeting
as superintendent or steward to Vipsanius Agrippa’s estates
in Sicily, as one whom Iccius might willingly oblige,for he
would never ask any thing not honest and just.

Ι ¹Crueu. XVI.

Otium divos rogat in patenti

Prensus AEgaeo, simul atra nubes

Condidit Lunam, neque certa fulgent
Sidera nautis ;

Otium bello furiosa Thrace,

Otium Medi pharetra decori,

Grosphe‚ non gemmis neque purpura ve·
nale neque auro.

. Non enim gazae* neque consularis
Summovet lictor miseros tumultus
Mentis, et Curas laqueata circum

Tectal volantes.

Vivitur parvo bene, cui paternum

Splendet in mensa tenui salinum :t

Nec leves somnos timor aut cupido
Sordidus aufert.

Quid brevi sortes jaculamur aevo
Multa? Quid terras alio calentes

Horace here, as elsewhere, distinguishes the comparative poverty of a
small independence from absolute neediness and squalor. The poverty
he praisesis not without its own modest refinements. The board may
be simple, but still it can display the old family salt-cellar, kept with
religious care. If the owner has not increased the paternal fortune, he
has not diminished it.
