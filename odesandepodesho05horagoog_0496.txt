Epode IX. 487

Horace was even acquainted with him at that time. There
must have been some other reason ior this reticence‚ and
it is quite as likely to have been one oi artistic taste as one
founded on personal or political considerations; sor Horace
does not mention by name Cleopatra, nor even Sextus
Pompeius. It is consistent with the dignity os lyric song
to avoid the direct mention oi the name of our national
enemy, especially if conquered. In an English lyrical
poem on the Crimean war, we should scarcely think it

strange it' the poet did not obtrude on us the nameus
Nicholas.

Canu. IX.

Quando repostum Caecubum ad festas dapeS,
Victore laetus Caesare,

Tecum sub alta, sic Jovi gratum, domo,
Beate Maecenas* bibam,

Sonante mixtum tibiis carmen lyra,
Hac Dorium, illis barbarum?

Ut nuper, actus cum freto Neptunius
Dux† fugit, ustis navibus,

Minatus Urbi vincla, quae detraxerat
Servis amicus perfidis.

Romanus,‡ eheu, posteri negabitis,
Emancipatus feminae,

Fert vallum§ et arma miles, et spadonibus
Servire rugosis potest,

the Son ol Neptune. Thougb Horace speaks ot' the rejoicing at the
defeat oi Sextus Pompeius as if it were oi late (⁸¹ ut nuper ‘’), it occurred
between tite and six years before (nuc 718). Fugitive slaves formed
a large part oi the iorce oi Sextus Pompeius

t This does not refer to Mark Antouy himseli but to the Roman
soldiers underhim The singular number is used poetically. ·

§ “Fert vallum.'' The Roman soldiers carried palisades (¹¹vallu1n ”)
ior an empsled camp.
