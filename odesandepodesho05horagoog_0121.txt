110 T lu Odes of Horace.

ODE XX

. το merens.

Nothing can ¹be more simple in form and spin't than this

ode, in which ¹Horace invites Maecenas to a homely enter· .

tainment in language equally unostentatious. In this, as in
other of Horace’s purely occasional odes, one seels, by the
abstemious avoidance oi the would-be poetical, that only a

poet

Thou wilt drink¹ but in modest cups Sabine wine humble
Which 1 with mine own hand in Grecian cask hoarded,

When the theatre hailed thee with plaudite beloved,
Knightly Maecenas,

So lond, as is sain that the gay phantom Echo

To thine ear from the heights nithe Vatican mountain,

To thine ear from the banks of thy river ancestral,
Might reapplaud them.

Thou mayst drink at thy will the rich Caeeuban vintage,
Orthe milder grapes Cales have tamed in its presses:
. F onnian slopes, vines Falernian, combine not to flavor'
My simple wineeups.
