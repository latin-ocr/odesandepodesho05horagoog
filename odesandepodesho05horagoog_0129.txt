The Odes ofHoracc.

ODE XXIII.

ΤΟ CHLOF..

This ode has the appearance of being imitated, though
but slightly, from a fragment in Anacreon preserved in
“ Athenaeus,” ix, p. 396. But it is not the less an illustration
os the native grace with which Horace invests his more
trivia] compositione

Like a sawn dost thou fly from me, Chloe,
Like a sawn that, astray on the hill-tops,
Her shy mother mIsses and seeks‚
Vaguely scared by the breeze and the forest

Sighs the coming of spring through the leaflets?
Slips the green lizard stirring a bramble?
Her lrnees knock togeffler with sear,
And her heart beats aloud in its tremor.

Nay‚ but notas a merciless tiger,
Or an African lion I chase thee3 -
Ah! cling to a mother no more,
When thy girlhood is ripe sor a lover.
