ODE Ill.

ΟΝ STEADFASTNESS Ol* PURPOSE.

The two preceding odes, addressed to youth, inculcare
the formation'ol· private character ; this ode and the two
that follow have apolitical intention and bearing. lu this
ode Horace commences with his famous picture ol' the
steadlast man not turned aside from that which his reason
and conscience hold to be right, either hy the excitement os
apopulace or the threat of a tyrant. Among the mortals
which the exercise ol this virtue has raised to the gods he
places Augustus, who certainly did not want linnness ol pur·
pose in founding and cementing his authority, and to whom
the Senate had already decreed the honors habitually paid
only to the divine powers. The poet’s mention ol Romulus
amongst those thus promoted to the rank of immortals,
leads on to what in itself appears, at first sight, a somewhat
prolix and irrelevant digression-viz, the speech of Juno
predicting the glories ol Rome, and prohibiting the resto
ration ol Troy. Closely examined, the digression is not
purely episodical, but in harmony with the preceding verses,
and a development os the purpose ol the whole poem, for
itis in the nature ol the steadlast man, unswayed hythe
fickle passions ol the time, to adhere firmly to the interest
of his country, and cherish the memory os its glories and
heroes. We are told by Suetonius (“ Life of Julius Caesar,’'
c. 79), that it was a current report that Julius Caesar medi-
tated adesign of transferring the seat of empire from Rome
to Alexandria, or to Ilium. Lucan, ix. 997, ascribes to him
the same intention. But we are not to suppose, with some,

that Augustus entertained any such notion: this ode in
itsell

s* Not tlre rage of the million commandingthings evil,
Not the doom frowning near in the brows ol the tyrant,
