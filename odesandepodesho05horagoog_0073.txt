62 T he Odcs of Horace.

Themes so losty we slight ones attempt not, Agrippa,

Nor the terrible wrath ot unyielding PelideS,

Nor the fell house of Pelops, nor seas which Ulysses,
The double-tongued hero, explored

While the Muse that presides over lutestrings unwarlike,
And my'own sense os shame would forbid me to lessen,
By the inborn detect os a genius unequal,

The glories ot Caesar and thee.

Who can worthily sing Mars in adamant tunic,
Or Merion all grim with the dust·cloud ot Ilion, ' ,
Or Tydides, when, thanks to the favor ot Pallas,

He stood forth a match t'or the gods?

We of feasts, we of battles, on youths rashly daring
Waged by maids armed with nails too well pared sor
much slaughter, ,

Sing, devoid of love's fleme ; or, if somewhat it scorch us, 1
still wont to make light ot the pain.
