500 The Epodcs os Horace.

EPODE XV.

TO NEAERA.

This poem may have been an imitation oi the Greek, but
as Horace pointedly introduces his own name as that of the
complainanh it must be inserted that, at all events, he meant
to be understood as speaking in his own person. The proh

ability

'Twas night-the moon shone iorth in cloudless heaven

Amid the lesscr stars,
When thou didst mock‚ in vows myseli had taught thee,
' The great presiding gods 3

Closer than round the ilex clings the ivy,

Clasping me with twined arms: Ι

“Longas the woli shall prey upon the sheepiold-

Long as the scaman’s soe, Ι
Baleiul Orion, rouse the wintry billows—
Or the caressing breeze
Ripple the unshom ringlets oi Apollo,
Our mutual love shall be l''
· Ahl thou shalt mourn to find me firm, Neaera3
For ii in Flaccus aught
. Oi man he leit, he brooks not halved embraces;
Stooped to no second rank,
His love shall leave th'ee, and explore its equal.
The heart, in which the pang
Oi the last treason once makes sure its entry,
Is ever henceiorth prooi
To charms which perfidy has rendered halelul.
· And thou, 0 happier one l
Whoe’er thou art, in my defeat exulting‚
Be rich in herds and lands3
