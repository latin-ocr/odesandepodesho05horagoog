Thaliarchus signifies in Greek “arbiter bibendi ’'-com·
monly translated “seastrnaster.” Some editors, as DiiIen·
burget and Macieane, refusing to consider it meant to bea
proper name, print “thaliarche,” “O ieasunaster.’' Orelli
and Yonge, however, retain the capital T, and it is perhaps
more agreeable to Horace's habit of individualizing generals,
and is certainly more animated in itseli to consider, with
Buttmann, that the word is meant sor a proper name, though
oi course a fictitious one, and invented to signiiy the oiiicial
character oi the person addressed. 1 may also add that
there is no instance,1 believe, in Latin authors, in which
the word thaliarchus is used as a ieastmaster3 and that,
therefore, tf Horace did not mean it to be considered a

proper

See how white in the deepsallen snow stands Soractet
Laboring iorests no longer can bear up their burden ;
And the rush os the rivers is locked,

Halting mute in the gripe of the frost.

'show the cold 3 more and more on the hearth heap the iagots-
, More and more bringing bounteously out, Thaliarchus,
The good wine that has mellowed iour years

In the great Sabine twohandled jar.

Leave the rest to the gods, who can strike into quiet
Angry winds in their war with the turbulent waters,
Till the cypress stand calm in the sky—
Tiil there stit not a leaf on the ash.
