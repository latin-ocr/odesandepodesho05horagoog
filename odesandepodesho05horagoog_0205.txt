194 The Odes ofHorate.

Wean thy heart then at last irorn these memories too sust,
Let us chant the fresh trophics our Caesar has won,
Linking on, to the nations'subdued, ,

Bleak Niphates* all ice-locked, the Mede’s haughty
river,

Now submissiver hurnbiing the erest of its waves 3
While the edictos Rome has imprisoned the Scyths,
In the narrow doruain os their steppes,
And the steed os each rider halts reined at the borders.

¹· ‘¹ Rigidum Niphaten,
Medumque flumem

That Niphates was the name os a mountain-range east oi the Tigrisis
certain ; whether there was also a river os that name is much disputed,
though Lucan and Juvenal take it for granted. Possibly the Tigris,
which, according to Strabo, rises on the mountain-range oi Niphates,
may be the river here meant. There uras a small river mlled Medus
which flowed into the Araxes, but this was too insignificant ior the uren·
tion Horace mulces oi the ‘⁴ Medum flumen,” evenis he knew os its exist·
ence; and most os the later commentatore concurin thinking the river
thus designated was the Euphrates.
