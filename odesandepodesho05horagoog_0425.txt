414 Ι T he Odes of Horace.

Who knows il the gods will yet add a tomorrow
To the sum os today?

Count as saved lrorn an heir’s greedy hands all thou givest
To that friend-thine own seli

When once dead, the resplendent* tribunal ol Minos ¹
Having once pronounced doom,

Noble birth, suasive longae, moral worth, Ο Torquatus,
Reinstate thee no more.

Her Hippolytus chaste from the midnight oi Hades
Dian's sels could not sree3

Lethe's chains coiled around his own best-loved Pirithous,
Theseus’ sels could not rend.

θ ““8ρ1ειιᾱὶἀι,’ an epithet more proper ol the court and trrhrml
than of the judgment (arbitria) given. . . . The choice oi poetic figure
by which to enlarge the simple notion, ‘eum semel occidesne was proh
ably suggested by Torquatus's own profession as an advocate, nlluded
to in Ep. 1. w. 8, o'’-Youur. Ritter takes the epithet as referring to
the splendor which surrounded the tribunal ol Minos, enabling him
more searchingly to inspect the souls whom he judged; and obseer
that the splendoris here opposed to “ tenebris,” line 25.
