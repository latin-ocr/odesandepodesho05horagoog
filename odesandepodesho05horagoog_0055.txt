Tlre Odcs of Horace.¹

Excuusus. 1
“Me doctarum hederae praemia frontium!

’ Wolff, Hare, Tate, and some other commentators, would
substitute ‘⁴ Te '' for “Me ’'-apptying the line to Maecenas,
“ :thee the ivy-the prize of learned brows-associates with
gods above; Me the cool woods, etc, set apart from the com-

And though the ivy was appropriate to poets, it was not ap

dressed to Iulius Florus) speaks of it as the reward of ex·
