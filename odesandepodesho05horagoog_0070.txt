Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa*
Perfusus liquidis urget odoribus,
Grato, Pyrrha, sub antro?†

Mutatosque deos flebit, et aspera ,
Nigris aequora ventis
Emirabitur insolens,

Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea3 ,
Qui 'semper vacuam, semper amabilem
“ Sperat nescius aurae

Fallacis. Miseri, quibus

Intentata nitesl Me tabula sacer
Votiva paries indicat uvida
Suspendisse potentiss
Vestimenta maris Deo.
