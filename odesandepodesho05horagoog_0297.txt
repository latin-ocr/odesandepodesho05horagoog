T he Odes os Horace.

Subject to Rome, and curbed in tardy setters, ’
The old Cantabrian socon shores Hispanian 3

Lo Ι the grim Scythians meditate retreating-
’ Lax {tre their bow-strings.

As one who takes in private life his leisure,

A while forego the overcare sor nations 3

Leave things severe; life offers one glad moment-
Seize it with gladness.
