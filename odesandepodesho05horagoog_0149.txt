138 The Odes of Horace.

ODE XXX

vanus rnvoxan ao cercenn’s rnna

This ode has the air of a conplimentary ccpy oi verses

to some fair freed-woman who had fitted up a pretty fane

to Venus, probably in the grotto, or antrum, attached to her
residence.

Venus, Ο queen of Cnidos and of Paphos, ·

Spnrn thy loved Cyprus—here transfer thy presence:

Decked is the sane to which, with incense iavish,
Glycera calls thee.

Bring with thee, glowing rosy red, the Boy-god,

Nymphs and loose-girdled Graces, and-is wanting

Thee, wanting charin—bring Youth, nor let persnasive*
Mercury fait us.

· For the addition of this explanatory epithet‚see the notes os Orelli
and Dillenburger.
