252 T lte odes os Horace. ¹

But now the vile guest os the Spartan adult’ress
Glitters sorth nevermore 5—the lorsworn race ol Priam

By the aid of its Hector, no more
Breaks in fragments the soree oi the Greek ;

Sunk to rest is the war so prolonged by our discords,
Ever hencesorth to Mars I give up my resentment,
And my grudge to the grandson* who springs
From the womb oi a priestess oi Troy.

Ι admit him to enter the luminous dwellings 3
1 admit him to sip† of the juices of nectar,
And, enrolled in the order serene
Ol the gods, to partake ot' their calm.

While between Rome and Ilion there rage the wide ocean,
May the exiles be blest wheresoe'er their dominion ,-
So long as the wild herd shall range,
And the wild beast shall litter her cubs

Undisturbed, 'mid the barrows os Priam and Paris,
May the Capitol stand, brightening earth with its glory‚
And dauntless Rome issue her laws
To the Mede she subdues by her arms.

Wide and far may the awe os her name be extended
To the uttermost shores, where the girdle oi ocean
Doth from Africa Europe divide,
And where Nile floods the lands with his swell.

Be she stronger in leaving disdalniully buried
ln the caverns oi earth the gold—better so hidden,

. *Romulus being Juno’s grandson, born oi Mars her son, and llia

the Trojan priestess
†“ Ducere nectaris succos.” “Ducere‚” ia, “sorbillere‚'' to sip.
