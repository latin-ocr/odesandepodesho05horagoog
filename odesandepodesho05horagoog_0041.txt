cause which invites translators to encounter that difficulty
has been sufficiently intimated in the preceding remarks-

viz„ the comprehensive range of his sympathy with human
beings He touches so many sides of character, that on one
side or the other he is sure to attract us all, and we seelr to
clothe in his words some cherished feeling or sentiment of
our own. Be that as it may, an unusual degree oi indul·

conjecture and dispute to commentators the most erudite,

May a reasonable share of such general indulgence be
vouchsafed to that variety in the mode of translation of which
