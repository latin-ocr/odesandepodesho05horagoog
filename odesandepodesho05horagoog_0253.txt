242 The. Odas osHoracc.

Why should I rear some hall sublime to Rome's last teste
e ed,
With pirllffed doors* which never ope but envy enters in?
Oh, why for riches, wearier sar,
Exchange my Sabine vale?

* “Postibus invidendis.” “Postes” were the jambs, columns, or
pilasters that flanked the entrance door, and the wordin osten used sor
the door itselt Ido not know of any authority sor interpreting “pos-
tes ” es the rows of pillars within the “ atrium ’³ itsels, which some com·
mentators are inclined to do.
