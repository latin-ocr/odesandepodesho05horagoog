452 The Epodes os Horace.

EPODE 1.

ΤΟ MAECENAS.

This epode is generally supposed to have been composed
when Augustus had summoned the leading public men,
whether senators or equites, to meet him at Brundusium
prior to the expedition against Antony and Cleopatra which
resulted in the battle ot' Actium, arne. 723. The poem war·
rants the assumption that Maecenas had been then appointed
to, or offered,a naval command 3 but it seems (Dio. 51, 3,
and Seneca, Ep. 114, 6) that Augustus decided on retaining

him
So thou wilt go with thy Libumian galleys,
Arnongst, O friend, those giant floating towers3
Prepared to share all perils braved by Caesar,
And ward them off, Maecenas, by thine own.
But what ol us, to whom, while thou survivest,
Life is ajoy 3—thee lost, a weary load?
Shall we, as bidden, take our ease contented3
Ease has no sweetness if not shared with thee 3
. Or shall we bear our part in thy great labor
As fitting men oi no unmanly mouldi
Yes, we would bear 3 and theeo'er Alpine summits,
Or through the nastes of guestless Caucasus,
Or where the last pale rim ol the horizon
Fades on the iarthest waters ot' the west,
Follow with soul undaunted. Dost thou ask me
How, weak in body, and unskilled in war,
My toil could lighten 'thinel 1 should be present
With terrors less than those the absent know3
Even as the bird more dreads ior her young nestlings,
r Il ior a moment lest, the gliding snake 3
