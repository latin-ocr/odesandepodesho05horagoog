304 The odes of Horace.

ODE XIII.

ΤΟ THE BANDUSIAN FOUN'I'AIN. ·

The site ol this lountain has beena matter oi controversy,
interesting to those who seek to ascertain the localities ol
places endeared to them by the poets. Acron and others

Venusia

Fount oi Bandusia, more lucid than crystal‚
Worthy ol honeyed wine, not without flowers,
ι 1 will give thee tomorrow a kid,
Whos'e front, with the budded horn sweiling,

Predicts to his future lile Venus and battles3

He shall tinge with the red oi his blood,
Fated child ol the⁴ lrolicsome peoplel

· The scorch os the' dog-star’s lell season forbears thee 3

Ever friendly to grant the sweet boon of thy coolness
To the wild flocks that wander around,

And the oxen that reek from the harrow.

1 will give thee high rank and renown among lountains,
When 1 sing oi the ilex o’erspreading the hollows
Ol rocks, whence, in musical sall*

Leap thy garrulous silvery waters.
