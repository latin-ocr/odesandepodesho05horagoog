According to Franke, Horace’s escape {rom the tree was
in nuc. 728. Ritter places it in 7²4· This poem corn·
memorates the anniversary of that accident.

Thou marvellest why these hymeneal Kalends
Ol March† I keep-I, solitary Caelebs,

Wherefore these flowerets?

This censer full ol incense? this heaped suel
On the live sod? Know that, escaped the death-blow
Of the dire trec, 1 a white goat to Bacchus

Vowed‚ and feast-offerings.

The day, thus sacred, wilh the year returning,

Tullus the Consul.

In honor of thy driend thus saved, Maecenas,

Quali brimming cups-a hundred be the number;

Let the gay lights watch with usior the morning,
N olse and brawl hanished.

Cast off the burden oi a statesman’s trouble,

Routed are Cotiso’s fierce Dacian armies,

Mede wroth with Mede, upon fraternal slaughter,
Wastes his wild fury.§
