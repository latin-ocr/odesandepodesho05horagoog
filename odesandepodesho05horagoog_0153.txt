142 · The OdesofHorace.

'ODE XXXII. μ

ΤΟ His LYRE.

This short invocation to his lyre has the air oi a prelude
to some meditated poem ol greater importance. Several
ol the Manuscripts commence “Poscimus,” which reading ι
Bentley adopts. The modern editors agree in prelerring
“Poscimur,’' which has more ol the outburst ol song, and
renders the poem more directly an address to the lyre.

We are summoned. If e’er, under shadow sequestered,

Has sweet dalliance with thee in light moments ol leisure

Given birth to a something whichlives, and may, haply,
Live in years later, '

Rouse thee now, and discourse in the strains os the Roman,
Vocal shell, first attuned by the patriot ol Lesbos,
= Who, in war though so fierce, yet in battle, or mooring
On the wet sea-saud

His harh, tempesttossed, chanted Liber, the Muses,

Smiling Venus, the Boy ever clinging beside her,

And, adorned by dark looks and by eyes os dark lustre,
Beautilul Lycus.

Ο thou grace of Apollo, Ο charm in Jove’s banquets,
Holy shell, dulcet solace ol labor and sorrow,

O respond to my greeting, when 1, with rite solemn,
Duly involre thee.
