Introduction. xvii

the picture 01 Europa borne from the field-flowers 10 the
midst of the ocean. We behold het forlorn and alone 03
the shores of Crete-heerken to the burst 01 her despair and
repentance—and see the drama conclude with the consola·
tory appearance of Venus, and Cupid with his loosffll bow.

To some commentators these vivid presentations 01 dramatic
imagery have appeared exotic to the poem—episodes and
interludes. But the more they are examined as illustrative
ol Horace's peculiar culture of lyric art, the more (in this re ·

spect not unimitative 01 Pindar) they stand out as the body ·

01 his piece, and the developed completior 01 his purpose.
Take them away, and the poems themselves would shrink
into elegant vers d'occasrhrr. Horace, in aword, generally
studies to secure to each of his finer and more careful poems,
however brief it be, that which play-writers call “a back·
bone.” And even where he does 301 obtain this through
direct and elaborate picture of dramatic effect and interest,
he achieves it perhaps in 3 single staura, embodying some
striking truth or maxim 01 popular application, expressed
with a terseness so happy, th'at all times and 311 nations
adopt it as a proverb.

We see, then, how much of his art in construction de-
pends on his lavish employ 01 picture and drama-how
much on compression and brevity. We must next notice, as
constituent elements 01 Horace‘s peculiar charm, his employ-
ment 01 playful irony, and the rapidity 01 his transitions from
sportive to earnest‚ earnest to sportive ς so that, perhaps, 30
poet more avails himself 01 the effect 01 “ surprise '’-yet the
surprise is not coarse and glaring, but for the most part sin·
gularly subdued aud delicate-arising sometimes from a sin-

that combination 01 tragic and comic elementa to which the
·critics 01 a former age objected in Shakspeare, than per-
haps any poet extant except Shakspeare himself. The con-
sideration 01 this admirably artistic fidelity 10 the mingled
