326 Τ lu Odes os Horace.

Chasing qare from the brows of the wise,
Thou unlockest their hearts to Lyaeus.*

Hope and nerve thou restorest to minds worn and harassed‚
Add'st the hom that exalts to the front os the beggam
Fresh from thee he could face down a king,
Fresh from thee, brave the charge osan army.

Thee‚ shall Liber and Venus‚·if Venus come merry,
And the Graces, reluctant their bond to dissever‚
And the living lights gayly prolong,
Till the stars fly from Phoebus returning.

³ “Retegis Lyaeo.” “The dative case, ‘to' Lyaeus, appears here to
be employed rather than the ablative.¹’-Om.1.1.
