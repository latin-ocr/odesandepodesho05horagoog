ODE XII.
ro mecenas.

The Licymnia (or, as the scholiasts spell it, Licinia) cele·
brated in this ode was most probably Terentia, the wile os
Maecenas; and if so, the‘poem was evidently written within

ι afew years aster their marriage. Itis not pleasant to think

that the wedded happiness so charmingly described was of
briel duration, and that the t'aults laid to the charge ol the

lady embittered the life of Maecenas at its close. Some of

the

Aslr no high-sounding themes lrom this lute’s relaxed num·
bers,

Suited neither to strains os long wars with Numantia,

Nor os Hannibal dire, nor ol waters Sicilian
Which Carthago made red with her blood ,·

Nor ol Lapithae fierce, and the great drunlren Centaur3

Nor ol Earth’s giant sons, overbome by Alcides,

Threat'ning perils that shook to its starry foundations
Old Satum's refulgent abode.

And sar better thy prose than my verse, O Maecenas,
Shall record, in grave story, the battles ol Caesar,

And the necks of the kings who have lostily threatened
His Rome, to pass under her yoke.

Me the Muse has enjoined sor the theme of my praises,

Thy lady Licymnia-her dulcet-voiced singings,

And the sunshine ol eyes that illumine her beauty‚
And the loving heart true to thine own.

Graces alike, whether joining at home in the dances,
Or contesting the palm in gay wit's playful skirmish,
Or amid holy sports on the leastday os Dian,

With virgins entwining the arm.
