Boy,1 detest the pomp os Persic sashions-

Coronals wreathed with linden rind* displease me;

Cease to explore each nook ior some belated
Roseus the autumn.

Weave with plain myrtle nothing else,I bid thee3

Thee not, in serving, misbecomes the myrtle,

Me not, in drinking, underneath the trellised
Bowery vinuleavesi

· ⁸ ‘¹ Philyra,” the rind oi the lime-trec used in elaborate gastanda
i “Sub arta vite-”¹¹21ta,” “close,”“e1nbowering;” as in the trellis·
ed vine-arbon still common in Italy and puts oi Gennany.
