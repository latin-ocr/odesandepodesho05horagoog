Book lla—Ode V. 267

and accepted military service under the conqueror ; and
in thus energetically representing the moral disgrace of
these men, Horace is very evidently opposing some propo
sirion men afloat sor demanding their restoration from the
. Parthians. Such demand, which would no doubt be urged
hythe relatives of the ditmar, and perhaps by many old
sellow·soldiers in the Roman army, might easily have ac·
quired the importance os what we call a party question.
And if Horace here opposes it, it is pretty certain that
Augustus opposed it also at that time. Hence the ode
would have been written before Augustus redetnanded (nuc.
73¹) the Roman captives and standards from Phraates.
And the date nuc. 728 or 729, assigned to the ode by
Orelli, is probably the true one. A demand which circum-
stances rendered reasonable and politic in 731, might have
been very inopportune and unwlse two or three years be·
sore. In aiming at his political object, Horace skilllully eludes
its exact definition. He begins by saying, that as it is by
his thunder we believe in Jove, so the power os Augustus
will be recognized when he shall have added the Britons
and Parthians to his empire. Thus, agreeably with the
oratorical character of his poetry, on which I have ol>
served in the preliminary essay, his exordium propitiates
the ear os the party he is about to oppose-viz., those
clamorous ior the restoration of the Parthian prisoners.

He follows this· exordium with a rapid outburst on the .

ignominy oi these very prisoners, and then, with admirable
boldness, places the argument against their restoration in

the mouth of the national hero Regulus. Itis in these and ·

similar passages that Horace not only soars immeasurably
above the level os didactic poetry properly so called, but ⁶
justifies his claim to a sar higher rank even in lyrical poetry
than many of his modern critics are disposed to accord to
him. He attains to that region of the sublime which be-
longs to heroic sentiment, and which is the rarest variety of
the sublime even in the tragic drama.
