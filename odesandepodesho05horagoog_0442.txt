Book lta-Ode XII. 4„

olive crop well, or that he had found a good investrnent for
his money, we might very well say to him, “ Put aside those
mercenary thoughts of gain, and corne and sup with us.”
There would be at once a jest and a compliment in the
irony of the implied accusation. That the Virgil addressed
must be a vender of perfumes, because he is asked to con·
tribute a pot of nard; or a banker or negotiator, because he
is exhorted to put aside the care of gain-and a scholiast in
a Paris MS. inscribes the ode, “Ad Virgilium Negotiato
rem,”-is a conjecture less plausible than that he was a phy·
sician of that name to the Neros, or a relation of C. Virgil
the praetor, Cicero’s friend.

Orelli and Yonge quote with approval Gesner’s remark,
“That there is nothing in the poem itself which pertains
more to the poet Virgil than to any other friend of Horace’s.”
On the other hand, it has been said that tho mythological
imagery and the description of Spring with which the poem
opens, are addressed with appropriate felicity to the Poet of
the Eclogues and Georgics.

The question does not seem to admit of positive solution
one way or the other. The reader must judge for himself
whether it is probable that Horace included in the F outth
Book a poem that, if addressed to Virgil the poet, he must
have written many years before 3 and whether if he did thus,
as Dillenburger contends, seek to revive the memory of his
early friend, it would have been in a poem of a comparatively
light character, and so wholly free from any reference to the
loss he had sustained.

Jam nec prata rigent nec fluuii strepunt
Hiberna nive turgidi.
