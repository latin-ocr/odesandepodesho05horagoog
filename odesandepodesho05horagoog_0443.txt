32 The Odes of Horace.

Now builds her nest the melancholy bird

Yet morning Itys 3 she, the eterual shume

Os Cecrops’ house sor vengeance too severe
On barbarous lusts ol kinge*

Swains ol sleek flocks on the young grass reclined,
Chant pastoral songs attuned to piping reeds,
Charming the god who loves the darksotne slopes

Ι And iolds ol Arcady 3 .

These, O my Virgil, are the days of thirst 3

But il, Ο client ol illustrious youths,

Calenian juices tempt, bring thou the nard,
And with it earn my wine 3

One tiny box of spikenard will draw forth

The cask now ripening in Sulpician† vaults,-

Caslt large enough to hold a world of hope,
And drowu a world ol care.

Quick! il such meniments delight thee, come

With thine own contributione to the feast 3

Not like n'ch host in prodigal hails-my cups
Thou shalt not tinge scot-free.

But put aside delays and care oi gain,
Warned, while yet time, by the dark death-lires 3 mix
With thought brief thoughtlessness 3 to be unwise

In time and place is sweet.

⁴ “Quod malebarbaras,
Regum est ulta libidinee”

Most authorities, Orelli amongst thern, take “male ’' with ‘⁸ ulta ”-via,
that the bird, whether Philomela or Pnocne, avenged too cruelly (nimis
atrociter) the guilt ol Tereus Ihave translated accordingly, but arn by
no means sure that ‘¹ male '¹ should not be taken, as Macleane suggests,
with “barbaras‘'-viz, the too barbarous, or evilly barbarous, lustu ol
kings, The bird is the eternal reproacn to the house oi Cecrope, not on
account ol the severity oi her vengeance, but on account ol the atrocity
