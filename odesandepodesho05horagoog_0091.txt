This poem is commonly inscribed very inappropriately ,
Ι “De Augusto,'' and sometimes more accurately “De laudi-
’ bus

What man, what hero, or what god select'st thou,

Theme ior sweet lyre or fise sonorous, Cliol

Whose honored name shall that gay spritevoice, Echo,
Hymn back rebounding,

Whether on Helicon's umbrageous mergent,

Whether on heights of Pindus or cold Haemus,

Whence woods, at: random, vocal Orpheus followed?
He who stayed rivers

In their swill course, and winds in their wild hurry
By art maternal ς* and with bland enchantment
Led the huge oaks athis melodious pleasure

, List’ning his harpstrings.

Whom should Ι place sor wonted rites ol‘ homage

Before the Father·King os gods and mortuis,

Who earth, and ocean, and heaven’s varying seasons†
Orders and tempers,

From whom not greater than Himself proceedeth-
. 'l'o whom exists no semblance and no second?

Yet where he hath a nearest, be its honors
Sacred to Pallas.

⁶ “Arte matema”—the Muse Calliope, mother oi Opheus
† “Qui mare ae terras variisque mundum
Temperat horis'’ ·
⁸⁴ Mundum '‘ here means “coelum‚'' “sky ”-i e, the whole iramework
oi nature, in sea, earth, and heavenis under the dominion os Jove.
