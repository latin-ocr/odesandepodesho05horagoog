Epodetss. 483

date os this ode. This supposition is not tenable, sor Cassius
Severus, as Orelli remarks, must have been a boy, or a youth
ol about twenty, when the ode was composed3 nor is there
any authority on record that Cassius Severus was a poet.
Other commentators have supposed the person meant was
Maevius or Bauius Is the right name be Cassius, nothing
is known about him Í¾ nor is it of any importance. Horace's
invective, lor what we know to the contrary, might have
been as unjust and inappropriate as the lampoons ol irritable
young poets generally are. Ritter conjectures the person
there satirized to have been Furius Bibaculus, notorious sor
the bitterness os his iambics, and who included Octavian
Caesar in his attacks.

annr. v1.

Quid immerentes hospites vexas, canis,
Ignarus adversum lupos?

Quin huc inanes, si potes, vertis minas, 1
Et me remorsurum petis?

Nam, qualis aut Molossus, aut sulvus Lacon,
Amica vis pastoribus, '

Agam per altas aure sublata nives,
Quaecunque praecedet sera:

Tu, curn timenda voce complesti nemus,
Projectum odoraris cibum.

Cave, cave: namque in malos asperrimus
Parata tollo cornua 3

Qualis Lycambae spretus infido gener,
Aut acer hostis Bnpalo*

An, si quis atro dente me petiverit,
Inultus ut flebo puer?
