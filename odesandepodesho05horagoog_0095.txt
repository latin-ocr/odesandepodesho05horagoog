84 Tlu Odas cy Horace.

Father and Guardian of all human races,

Saturnian Jove, to thee the Fates have given

Charge o'er great Caesar ; mayst thou reign supremely,
Next to thee Caesar.

Whether the Parthians over Rome impending “
Gracc his full* triumph, or the larthest dwellers,
Indian and Seric, upon Orient margins

Under the sunrise,†

Wide earth with justice he shall mle, thy viceroy 3

With ansul chariot Th0u shalt shake Olympus3

Thou through the sacred g‘roves profaned impurely
Launch angry lightnings.‡

¹ “Justo triumpho'' “⁸Justo: ‘regulam lull, complete,' in which
sense this adjective is attached to such nouns aa exercitus, legio, acies,
praelium, victoria”-Yovor.

't “ Sive subjectos Orientis orae Ι
Seras et Indos.”

The Seres, whom some conjecture to be the Chinese, represent the na·
tione at the larthaat east known to the Romans. ‘⁸ subjectos orae,”
“under the edge or extremity ol the ΕΒΗ-γουσι

l “Tugravicurruquaties Olympum,
Tu pamm castis inimica mittes
Fulmina lucis.”

The general meaning seems to be, that Jove lest the political govern-

ment ol earth to Augustus, his vicegerent; but he reserved to himself

alone the dominion os heaven, and the taslr os avenging such crimes as
odended the gods, or polluted the sanctity of the temples.
