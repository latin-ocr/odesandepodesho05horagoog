380 The Odes of Horace.

Noble and saitis he3

Nor his the lips to pleading suitors mute 3
Youth os a hundred erts

To bear thy conquering standards wide and iar;

Whene'er some rival rich
In gifts, he conquers, laughing, he shall place,
By Alban wetere, under citron rooh,
Imaged in marble, Thee.

There shalt thou take delight
In spiced balms, and songs commingied sweet
With Berecynthian nse

And lyre—nor silent be the fluten reed.

There, twice a-day, shall youths

Choral with tendet maidens, chant thy name,
As thrice, in Salian clance,

Quakes the green' sod to feet that twinkle white.

But rne nor youth nor maid
Allures‚ nor saith in intermingled souls‚
Nor to contend in wine 3
No vernal flowerets wreathe my temples now.
