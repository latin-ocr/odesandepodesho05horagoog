Of his chaste wife and children, as aman

Of social rites bereth*
A citizen no more, and bent to earth

In stern humility his manly face,
Till his inflexible persistence hxed
The Senate's wavering will 5
And form, bewept, the glorious exile passed.

Albeit he knew what the barbarian skill

He motioned from his path
The opposing kindred, the retarding crowd,

Calmly as is, some client’s tedious suit
Closed by his judgment,† to Venafrian plains
Or mild Tarentum, built
By antique Spartans, went his pleasant way.

⁸ “Capitis minor.” The expression significa the man who has lost
hir civil rights, as did the Roman citizen taken prisoner by the enemy.
ψ The patrone were accustomed to settle the disputo between their

clienta.
