O nata mecum consule Manlio,

Seu tu querelas, sive geris jocos

Seu rixam et insanos amores,
Seu facilem, pia testa* somnum,

Quocunque lectum nomine† Massicum
Servas, moveri digna bono die,
Descende,‡ Corvino jubente
Promere languidiora vina.

Non ille, quamquam Socraticis madet
Sermonibus, te negleget horridus:
Narratur et prisci Catonis

Saepe mer0§ caluisse virtus.

Tu lene tormentum ingenio admoves
Plenrmque duro; tu sapientium
