Book lL-Ode X Vlll. 22 5

It abounds in trochees. I can only. attempt to gIve a gen·
eral idea of its trIppingness and brevity of sound. It treats,
with more than usual beauty‚ Horace’s favorite thesis of
declamation against the grasping nature of avarice; and, as
Dillenburger observes, it takes up and expands the sentiment
with which he had closed Ode xvi. Ι

Canu. XVIII.

Non ebur neque aureum

Mea renidet i'n domo lacunar3
Non trabes HymettIae*⁶

Premunt columnas ultirna recIsas

AfrIea5 neque Attulit
. Ignotus heres regiam occupavi3
Nec Laconicas mihi '
Trahunt honestae purpuras clientae.‡

At fides 'et ingeni

Benigna vena est, pauperemque dives
Me petit3 nihil supra

Deos lacesso, nec potentem anucum

Largium flagito,

Satis beatus unicis SabinIs.
Truditur dies die,

Novaeque pergunt interire Lunae:

Attalus did not know the persons hef enriched⁸ Torrentius supposes
the lines to refer to AristonIcus, who, after the death of Attalus, seized

on the throne by false pretenses, defeated Licinius Crassus, was after·
wards conquered by Perpenna, carried to Rome, and strangled in prison
by orders of the Senate. The former interpretation is preferable.

ss “⁴Honestae clientas! 1 have seen no satisfactory expianation of
the words ‘honestae clienta! MnLong has suggested to me that they
may refer to the rustic women on a man's farms—the wives of the
Coroni.”-Mrcmurr.
