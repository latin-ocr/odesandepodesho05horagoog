Religious games, called Ludi Tarentini, Terentini, or
Taurii, had been held in Rome from an early period ol the
Republic. Their origin is variously stated, though the most
probable mythical accounts agree that they were instituted
and devoted to Dis and Proserpina in consequence ol a
searsul plagae—whether by one Valerius in gratitude sor the
recovery of his three children, or in the reign ol Tarquinius
Superbus in order to propitiate those sormidable deities. In

Tarquins, “the Tarenti and Taurii are but as different forms
of the· same word, and of the same root as Tarquinius ”
(Smith's Dict, art. “Ludi Saeculares''). Il so, the deities
honored were doubtless Etrurian-not Greek nor Roman—
though the Romans subsequently identified them with divini·
ties familiar to their own worship.

Be that as it may, during the Republic these gemes appear
to have been only celebrated three times at irregular intervals
in no way connected with fixed periods or cycles (saecula).

When Augustus had completed (nuc. 737) the second ’
lustre, or the ten years for which the imperial power was

first confided to him, it was yery natural that he should wish
lor the solemnity of an extraordinary festival at once popular
and religious, and probably also the desire os establishing a
dynasty would give rise to the idea of rendering this solem-
nity regular, but at lardistant dates; thus associating in-
directly the duration of the Empire with the welfare and ex·
