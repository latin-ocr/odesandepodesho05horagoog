less imitated from one by Aloeus, ol which onlya single
verse is preserved. The metre of the ode has given much
trouble to commentators, especially to those who insist upon
the theory that all Horace's odes are reducible to quatrain
' stanzas, while this ode is in a stanza of three lines, accord·
ing to the authority oi MSS. (with the exception os the
· Turinese one). An attempt to remodel it into quatrain will
be found in Orelli's excursus to the ode, and is adopted by

Yonge in his edition.

Canu. XII.

Miserarum est neque amori dare ludum, neque dulci
· Mala vino lavere, aut exanimari metuentes
Patruae verbera lingue*

Tibi qualum Cythereae puer ales, tibi telas
Operosaeque Minervae studium aufert, Neobule, ⁴
Liparaei nitor Hebri,

Simul unctos Tiberinis humeros lavit in undis,
Eques ipso melior Bellerophonte, neque pugno
Neque segni pede victus;

Catus idern per aperhun fugientes agitato
Grege cervos jaculari, ct celer alto latitantem ·
Fruticeto excipere aprum.
