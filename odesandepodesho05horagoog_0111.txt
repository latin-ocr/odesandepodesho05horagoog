ODE XVII.

lnvlrmou To TYNDARIS.

It is impossible to do more than conjecture whether the
person addressed under the leigned name of Tyndaris ac-
tually existed or not There are one or two touches in the
poem which seem to individualize her as a creature oi the
earth—such as the selection ol one particular song about
the rivalry oi Penelope and'Circe, which is not a theme
especially appropriate to the place of invitation, and may well
have been the favorite song oi some fair lute-player ς 3ηά

the

For Lucretilis ost nimble Faunus erchanges
So delightful its slopes‚ his Arcadian Lyoeus-
From my she-goats still turning aside

Rainy winds 3ηά the scoreh os the sun.

All in saiety the wives oi the strong-scented husband
Rove where arbute and thyme lurk in woodlands secreted;
Never green adder daunts them, nor there
Martial wolf from Haedilia deseends,

Whilesoever, my Tyndaris, round and about us
Ring ¹the smooth sheeny lime-rocks oi sloping Ustica,
And the valleys embosomed below,
With 'the sweet haunting pipe oi the god.

Over me watch the gods with an aspect oi favor,
To the gods dear at heart are the muse and my worship.
Here our rich rural honors shall llow
From a brimmed cornucopia to thee.
