nothe Horace's servant, sor she is represented as sacrificing
according to her own choice and will. But this no servant
could do: the act oi sacrifice sor the whole family belonged
exclusively to the head ol the establishment The ode, if
addressed to any individual at all—which it probably was

Canu. XXIII. ·

Caelo supinas si tuleris manus
Nascente Luna, rustIca Phidyle,
Si thure placaris et horna
Fruge La'res, avidaque porca,

Nec pestilentem sentiet Africum*
Fecunda vitis, nec sterilem seges
Robiginem‚ aut dulces alumni

Pomisero grave 'tempus anno.

Nam, quae nIvali pascitur Algido

Devota quercus inter et ilices,
Aut crescit Albanis in herbis,†

· Victima pontificum secures

Cervice tinget: te nihil attinet
Tentare multa caede bidentium
