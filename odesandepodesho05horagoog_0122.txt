Book L-Ode XX. 111

poet could have written it The date of the poem has been
variously conjectured. Judging by the reference to the
Sabine wine which Maecenas is invited to drinlr, and which
came into use in its second year, reaching its prime in
its fourth, the poem would have been written between two
and sour years aster the reception that the audience at the
theatre gave to Maecenas on hi's recovery from his illness.
But the date os that event is not determined. Franke and
· Lubker refer the composition of the ode to amc. 729-730. .
Macleane favors the latter year. Orelli inclines to Weber’s
date,irom nuc. 726-727. ,

Vile potabis modicis Sabinum
cantharis, Graeca quod ego ipse testa
Conditum levi, datus in theatro

Cum tibi plausus

Care Maecenas eques, ut paterni

Fluminis ripae, simul et jocosa

Redderet laudes tibi Vaticani
Montis imago.

Caecubum et prelo domitam Caleno

Tu bibes uriam: mea nec Falernae -

Temperant vites, neque Formiani
Pocula colles.
