ODE V.

TO GABINIUS.

This poem is designated variouslyin the MSS. as “ Lalage,”
“ To the Loverof Lalage,” etc. According to one early MS.
(the Zun'ch), it is inscribed to Gabinius. But even Estrd
can not teli us who Gabinius was, though Orelli conjectures
him to have been son or grandson to A. Gabinius, Cicero's
enemy. The poem isos very general application, and the
leading idea is expressed with great elegance and spirit.

Not yet can she bear, with neck supple, the yoke,
Not yet with another submit to be paired ;
Immature for the duties os mate,
And the fiery embrace os the bull,

Thine heifer confines all her heart to green fields3
Now pausing to slake summer heats in the stream,

. Now with steerlings yet younger at play
Midst the sallows that drip on the shore.

Till ripe, do nbt long ¹sor the fruit os the grape ;
Arion varied Autumn shall deepen its hues,
And empurple the clusters that now
Do but pallidly peep from the leaf:

Arion, ’tis thysels she will seek ; fervent Time
Speeds on, adding quick to her youth’s crowning flower
Blooming seasons subtracted srom thine;
Then shall Lalage glow sor a spouse:

And then not so lovely the coy Pholon,
Nor Chloris resplendent with shoulders of snow,
As a moon in the stillness of'night
Shining pure on the calm os a sea ς
