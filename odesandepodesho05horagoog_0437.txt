ODE XI.

TO PHYLLlS.

As Horace had before (Lib. 111. 0d, xxviii.) invited Lyde
to the least-day ol Neptune,so he here invites Phyllis to cele
brate the birthday ol Maecenas in the Ides ol April. The date
ol the ode can not be determined, though it may be reasonably
conjectured that when he speaks ol Phyllis as his last love,
he was ol an age correspondent with the period at which the
Fourth Book was published. Nevertheless this is no sure in-
dex ; for, as Macleane shrffldly intimares, most men promise
the women they woo that she shall be the last love. To those
who insist upon giving literal individual personality to the
fictitious names Horace introduces into his poems, this poem
would seem written at a much earlier period, since Telephus,

'that universal ladykiller, is still described as “juvenis'' But
we have already seen that “juvenis '' by no means necessa-
rily signifies ayouth. I do not believe, with Macleane, that

Thou art dazzling whenever that binds up thy tresses
All my house laughs with plate3 clasped around with chaste
vervain,
Lo, mine altar stands thirsting the blood ol a lambkin
Soon to be sprinkled.

llud all hands are at work ; here and there run the ser'vants,
Men and maids, helter·skelter; the flame mounts in flicker,
