338 The Odes os Horace.

O were we penitent, indeed, lor'sins,*

How we should haste to cast gems, gauds, gold, useless
Save as the raw material ol all ill,

Amid the shouts oi multitudes applauding,

Into the vaults oi Capitolian Jove 3
Or that saie treasure·house—the nearest ocean!

To weed out avarica dig down to the root,
And minds relaxed rebrace by rougher training.

Look at yon high-born boy-—he can not ridel

Horseback too rude lor him-the chase too dangerousl
Skilliul and brave-to trundle a Greek hoop;

And break the laws which interdict the dice-box :l

While his mean father with a perjured oath
Swindles alike his partner and his hearth-guest.
Spurred by one passion-how to serape the pelf- ·
His worthless seli bequeaths an heir as worthless.

The immoderatess riches grow, forsooth, and grow,
But ne’er in growing can attain completion;
An unknown something, ever absent still,
Stints into want the unsufficing fortune.

i “Graeco trocho.’' This hoop, made of metat, was guided by arod
like our hoops nowadays. It seems to have been used in the thorough·
sares, and by youths as well as mere children. The laws against gam·
bling were stringent, and in Cicero’s time it was an offense sufficiently
serious ior Cicero to make it a grave charge against M. Antony that he
had pardoned aman condemned ior gambling, as he was himself an habitu·
al gambler. Juvenal says that the heir still in his insancy (bullatus) learnt
the dice from his father.

t “Improbae divitiae.” “improbae'' has not here the sense ol “dis-
honest” or “iniquitous,” asir is commonly translated; it meurs rather.
