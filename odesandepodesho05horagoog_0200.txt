very likely invented by Horace himself—as no doubt Cinara
was—and may possibly be an adaptation from Βαρῖνος, akind
ol fish Tbere is not a line in the poem to justily the wild
assumption ol some commentators that Horace himself was
in love with Rarius, whoever she was. Judging by internal
evidence, it seems to me that a real person was certainly
thus addressed‚ and in a tone which to such a person would
have been the most exquisite flattery; and as· certainly that
the person js not so addressed by a lover.

,Caura VIII.

Ulla si juris tibi pejerari

Poena, Barine‚ nocuisset unquam,

Dente si nigro fieres vel uno
Turpior ungui,

Crederem. Sed tu, simul obligasti

Perfidum votis caput, enitescis

Pulchrior multo, juvenumque prodis .
Publica cura.

Expedit matris cineres opertos

Fallere, et toto taciturna noctis

Signa cum caelo, gelidaque divos
Morte carentes. ⁸

Ridet hoc, inquam, Venus ipsa, rident

Simplices Nymphae,* ferus et Cupido

Semper ardentes acuens sagittas
Cote cruenta.
