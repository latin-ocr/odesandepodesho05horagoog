ODE XXVIII.

ΟΝ THE ram-Dav OF NEPTUNE.

It is but awaste oi ingenious triding to conjecture who or
what Lyde was, or, indeed, is any Lyde whatever existed else
· where than in the poet’s fancy. The poem is very lively
and gracelul, and evidently intended sor general popularity
as a song, without any personal application to the writer. ’

What, on the feastday os Neptune,
Can I do better? Up, Lyde l Out Irorn its hiding·place,
ui k,
Drag sciithcthe Caecuban hoarded;
Make an attack upon Wisdoml On to the siege os he'r
’ sorti

See how the noon is declining,
Yet, as if day were at stand-still, laggard, thou leav’st in
the store
Theucask which has lazily slumbered
Sinceliihulus acted as consul 3 now is its time to awake.

Sing we, by turns, os King Neptune,
And the green looks os the Nereids3 then to thy bow-
shapen lyre
Chant us ahymn to Latona,
And to the swiIt·Iooted Dian, and to her arrows os light ς

Then, as the crown os thy verses,
Chant to the {goddess who visits, borne on her car by the
swans,
¹ Cyclades, Cnidos, and Paphos;
Night, too, shall have her deserts‚ and lullabies rock her
to sleep.*
