Descende caelo, et dic age tibia
Regina longum Calliope melos*

Seu voce nunc mavis acuta,
Seu fidibus citharaque Phoebi.

Auditis, an me ludit amabilis
Insania? Audire et videor pios
Errare per lucos, amoenae
Quos et aquae subeunt et aurae.

Me fabulosae Volture in Apulo
Altricis extra limen Apuliael
Ludo fatigatumque somno
Fronde nova puerum palumbes
