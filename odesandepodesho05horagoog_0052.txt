translation a mette consisting oi our ordinary form oi blank ·
verse converted into a couplet by alternate terminations in
adissyllable and monosyllable 3 and though that is a very
simple, and may seem at first a very slight, modification oi a
familiar rhythm‚ it will be t'ound to constitute, in the regular
recurrence oi altemated terminals, a marked difference from
the chime oi our epic line, and is yet equally in unison with
the laws oi our prosody. Ι have adopted the same mette in

my version of the more important epodes‚ and in a ievr of
the other odes.

Maecenas atavis edite regibus
Ο et praesidium et dulce decus meum,
Sunt quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum
Collegisse juvat* metaque fervidis
Evitata rotis, palmaque nobilis.

Certat tergeminis tollere honoribus,

Quidquid de Libycis verritur areis.

Agros, Attalicis† condicionibus
Nunquam dimoveas, ut trabe Cypria
Myrtoum pavidus nauta secet mare.
