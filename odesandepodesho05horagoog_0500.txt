Epode X. 491

rum,'’ it is probable enough that he incurred the resentment
ol Horace and the scom ol Virgil by his attacks on their
modern style, and that his adherence to the elder forms of
Latin poetry was uncongenial to their own taste. For Vir·
gil's contemptuous mention, indeed, there might be some
cause less general, il Maevius and Bauius wrote the Anti·
Bucolica ascribed to them—i. e., two pastorals in parody ot'
the Eclogues ; and especially ilMaevius were the author
os a very ready and a very witty attempt to tum him into
ridicule. Virgil, reciting the First Book os his Georgics,
alter the words, “Nudus ara, sere nudus‚” came to a dead
halt, when some one, said to be either Maevius or Bauius,
finished the line by calling out, “habebis frigore febrem.”
Whoever made that johe must have been elever enough to
be a disagreeable antagonist One thing, at all events,
seems pretty revident—viz, that Maevius must have had
power ol some kind, to excite the muse ol Horace to so
angry an excess Had he been a man wholly without mark
or following, he could scarcely have stung to such wrath even
a youthful poet. Be that as it may, this ode has all the
vigor ot' a good hater, and there is much ol the gusto ol true
humor in its extravagance. The exact date ot' its composi·

tion is unknown, but it bears the trace ol' very early youth ,

Grotelend assigns it to nuc. 716, when Horace was twen-
ty-seven.
