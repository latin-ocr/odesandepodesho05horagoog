254 T lte Odes os Horace.

Than in wringing its uses to men,
With, a hand that would plunder the gods*

What limit soe’er may obstruet her in nature
Let her reach by her arms ; bounding blithely to visin
Either pole, where the mist or the sun
Holds the orgies oi water or lire:

1 to Rome's warlike race speak such lates, on condition
That they never, too pious to antique lorefathem,
N or confiding too sar in their power,
Even wish Trojan roofs to restore.

What though Troy could revive under auspices satal-
All her fortunes should be repetition oi camage 3
1 myself leading hosts to her doom-
Ι the consort and sister of Jove l

Rose her brazen wall thrice, with Apollo ior inundent
Still her brazen wall thrice should be raised by my Argives3 ,
Thrice the captive wile moum lor her lond,
Thrice the mother her children deplere.

Ah, this strain does not chime to my lute’s lively mensures!
Whither tendest thou, Muse? Cease, presumptuous, to inimic
The discourses oi gods 3 nor let down
To a music low-pitched, loity themes.

⁴¹ “Quam cogere humanos in usus
Omne merum rapiente dextra’¹

The point here, as Orelli observes, is in the antithesis between “hu-
manos '¹ and “ sacrum¹' Macleane paraphrases the general meaning ol
the passage thus-“let Rome extend her arms as she will, only let
her not, as her possessions increase, learn to priae gold above virtue.'’
The more literal meaning, according to Dillenburger and Orelli, is, that
in the lust os gold the hand ol rapine sacrilegiously despoils the sacred
vessels dedicated to gods in their shrines and temptes.
