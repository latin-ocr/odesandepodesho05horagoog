438 Ι The Odrs os Horace.

ODE XIV.

To AUGUSTUS, Ama rm: vtcrontss OF TIBERIUS.

The introduction to Ode iv. in this book has, sufficiently
sor the purpose, sketched the outline os the events which led
to the composition os this ode. As the former was devoted

to
By what care can the Senate os Rome, and Rome's people,
With a largess os honors sufficiently ample,
By what titles, what archives to time,

, Etemize thy virtues, Augustus,

Prince supremest, wherever the sun lights a region
That man can inhabit? What in war thou availest,
The Vindelici lately have learned,
·Free till then from the law of the Roman

By no even exchange in the barter os bloodshed‚*
Drusus, leading thy hosts, overthrew the ileet Breuni-
The Genauni-implacable race-
And the citadels piled upon Alps

Horror-brenthing3 then Nero the elder completed
Glories due to thine auspice in one crowning battle ;
Closed the raid oi the savage, and crushed
The grim might of the giam-like Raeti.

All conspicuous he rode where the fight raged the hercest,
Wasting down, to what wrecks! that array of stem bosoms,
Seli-surrendered as offerings to death,
In the stubborn devotion to freedom.

Through the loe went his way, as the blast o’er the billows
When the Pleiads are cleaving the rainclouds asunder,

’ “ Plus vioe simplici.'’ This does not mean “ more than once,” but,
as the scholiasts interpret, ‘⁶ with double loss to the enemy ς’* or lite·
