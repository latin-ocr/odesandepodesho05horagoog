Book l.-Ode Ill. 53

position that this ode was addressed to Virgil the poet, on
the occasion ol the voyage to Athens, from which he only
retumed to die: but there is no reason why Virgil should
not have made or contemplated such a voyage before the
last one; and Macleane‚ here agreeing with Dillenburger, is
“inclined to think such must have been the case.”-See
his introduction to this ode.

Canu. ΙΙΙ.

Sic te Diva potens Cypri,
Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,

Ventorumque regat pater
Obstrictis aliis praeter lipyga,

Navis, quae tibi creditum
Debes Virgilium finibus Atticis

Reddas incolumem precor,l
Et serves animae dimidium meae.

Illi robur et aes triplex

Circa pectus erat, qui fragilem truci
Commisit pelago ratem

Primus, nec timuit precipitem Africum

Decertantem Aquilonibus

Nec tristes Hyadas, nec rabiem Noti,
Quo non arbiter Hadriae

MaJor, tollere seu ponere vult freta.

certainly true, that the 2d pers pres subj. (reddas), is neret used as a

, mere imperative‚=‘redd'e.’ lt maybe used precatrbelyin addressinga

deity, asuperior (or in politeness), as ‘serves’ inOde xxxv. l 29. Where
it is used with ‘precor,·’ the verb is not in parenthesis, but distinctly gov-
ems ‘reddas,’¹1¹pray you to renden’ There should therefore be no
comnn between them; and this view shows ‘precor’ to be the true
apodosis ol the passage.”
