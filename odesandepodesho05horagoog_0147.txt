136 The Odes eff Horace.

ODE XXIX.
rorcc1us.

In the rath Ode of this Book Horace referred to the
expedition Into Arabia Felix meditated by Augustus, and -
which was sent srom Egypt, nuc. 730, under the command
of the Governor of Egypt, AEl'nus Gallus Many Roman
youths were attracted to this expedition by love of adven-
ture and hope of spoil; among others, the Iccius here ad-
dressed, who survived to become the peaceful steward to Vip
sanius Agrippa’s estates in Sicily. The good-natured banter
on the warlike ardor concered hya student ol philosophy,
was probably quite as much enjoyed by Iccius himself as ,
by any one. They who suppose that so well-bred aman ol
the world as Horace is always insinuating moral reprooss to
the Iriends he publicly addresses, are the only persons likely
to agree with the scholiasts that he means gravely to rebuke
Iccius lor avarIce ln coveting the wealth ol the Arabs

So, Iccius, th0u grudgest their wealth to the Arabs,
Wouldst war on kings Sheban‚ as yet never conquered,
And art sternly preparing the chains
For the arms os the terrible Mede?

What virgin barbaric shall serve thee as handmaid,
Her betrothed being laid in the dust by ffly lalchIon?
And what page, born and bred in a court,
Nor untaught Seric arrows to launch

From abowstring paternal, with locks sleek and periumed
Shall attend at my leasts, and replenish my goblets?
Wbo that slvers can llow to tbe'u lounts,
And the Tiber tuns back, will deny,

II the sage of a promIse so rare can surrender
All that priceless collection, the works ol Panaettus,

And the school in which Socrates taught,
In exchange lor a Spanish cont-mail?
