ODE VIII.

TO CENSORINUS.

On stated times, as in the Kalends of March and January,
it was the custorn os the wealthier Romans to rnake presents
to their friends. To this 'custom Horace refers, sending his
verses to Censorinus, as the most acceptable gift he could
offer. C. Marcus Censorinus was a man oi consular rank,
bore a high reputation, and died greatly regretted.

Goblets and bronzes rare, my CensorInus,
1 on my friends would heartily bestow3 .

I’d give them tripods, as Greece gave her heroes-
Nor should the meanest os my gifts be thine,

Were Ι but rich in artsul masterpieces
Such as a Scopas or Parrhasius wrought,*

When one in stone, in liquid hues the other,
Now hxed a mortal, now enshrined a god.

Not mine that wealth,† nor do such dainty treasures
Fail to thine affluence nor allure thy mind 3

That which channs thee is song: song I can proffer,
And set a value on the giit 1 bring.

Marbles inscribed with a state’s grateful praises,
Wherein great chiestains live and breathe again:

⁸ The flightsss oi Hannibal, his threats hurled backward,

And impious Carthage perishing in flames,

Made not more iamed than did Calabrian Muses
Him who bore off irorn conquered Africa

As his own spoils-a Namei Nor aught thy guerdon,
Is scrolls be mute upon thy deeds os good.

*Scopas was asamona sculptor oi Paros, acoording to Pausanias,
flourishing about 450 years uc. Parrhasius, a palmer, native of Ephe·
¹stu, about 400 nc. He was a contemporary and rival of Zeuxis.
