204 Τ lte Odes ofHordce. -

Say, sor all that Achaemenes boasted os treasure‚

All the wealth which Mygdonia gave Phrygia in tribute,
All the stores os all Araby-say, wouldst thou barter
One lock os Licymnia's bright hair?-

When at moments she bends down her neck to thy kisses, .

Or declines them with coy but not cruel denial 3

Rather pleased is the prize be snatched off by the spoiler‚ ·
Nor slow in reprisal sometimes.
