, 386 T lte Odes of Horace.

Looks srorn the car which, up the sacred hill,
Drags the Sygambri;

He, than whom never to this earth have Fate

And kind gods given, nor shall give, ev'n is yet

The Golden Age come back to mortals, aught
Better or greater.

Chant thou the games that honor the return

Ol brave Augustus granted to our prayer;

The joyous leastdays, the hushed courts ol law,
Vacant of suitors.

Then, too, if aught that 1 can speak be heard,

My voice shall uid to swell the choral hymn,

And sing “ All hail, thou sair auspicious sun,*
Bringing back Caesar l”

And while, O god oi triumph, slowly on†

He moves in state, shout upon shout repeats

“ Io Triumphe !’' through the length os Rome ς
Frankincense steaming

’ Up to benignant gods. Ten bulls, ten kine,
Aequit thy v0w3 a single steerling mine,
Fresh-weaned, and browsing into youth amid

Prodigal pastures;

⁸ “Rom
Pulcher! 0 laudande! canam, recepto
Caesare ieliru”

lt is uncertain whether “felix‘’ refers to llorace, as “happy in the re·
turn ol Caesar,'' or to the sun, forming part ol the exclamation3 Mac·
leane leaves the choice to the reader's taste; Vossius and others prefer
the latter applicatiou; Orelli oonsiders the former more tender. 'ro me
it seems more according to the genius os lyrica! composition to apply
the epithet to the sun. We know already that Horace is happy in the
return ol Caesar, otherwise hc would not be joining in the procession and
the hymn.
