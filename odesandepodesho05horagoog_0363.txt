352 Τ lte odes of Horace.

“ ‘ To card the wool oi some barbarian mistress,

And share with her the base lov'e of a savage! '’

While thus she raved despairing‚ Venus soitly
Neared her,arch·smiiing, ·

With the bey-archer-but his bow was loosened ; ,

’ · And sating first ber mirth, thus spoke the goddess:

‘⁴ Thou wilt not scold when this loathed bull returning,
Yields to' thy merey.

“ Know thysels bride of Jove the aii-subduing.
Hush sobs; learn well to bear thy glorions fortune 3
Thou on one section os the globe* bestowest

N ame everlnsting.”

⁵ “Sectue orbis ” liternlly means “hali the worid‚” as the ancients
divided our planet only into the two great divisione, Europe and Asia.
