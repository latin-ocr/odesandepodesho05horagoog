Tlee Odes of Horace.

Day treads upon the heels of day,
New moons wane on to perish3

Thou dn the brink of death dost make
Vain contracts sor new marble 3

Building proud homes, and os thy last-—
The sepulchre-forgetfu13

Asis the earth itsels too small
Thou robb’st new earth from ocean,

And,urging on a length os shore
Upon the deep’s foundation,

Th0u thrustes't back the angry wave
That wars in vain on Baiae*

What, must thou also, greedihg still,
Remove thy neighbor’s landmark*
Must ruthless avarice overleap
Each sence ol humble clients?

And man and wallingl wile, expelled
The dear paterna} dwelling, ’ “
Clasp ragged babes and exiled gods
To wandering homeless bosoms?

And yet no surer hall awaits ,
The wealthy tyrant master,
Than that which yields yet ampler room

Ι In yet more greedy Orcus.

Where sarther tend? Impartial earth
Opes both sor‚prinee and peasant;

No gold bribed Charon to row back
The erasty-souled Prometheus.

Death holds the haughty Tantalus 3
Death holds his children haughty:

Invoked or not, Death hears the poor,
And He gives rest to labor.
