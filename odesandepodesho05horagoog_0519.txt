510 Τ lu Epodes cffHorace.

ι Nor rich seeds parch within the sweltering glebe.

Either extreme the King of Heaven has tempered.
Thither ne’er rowed the oar of Argonaut‚ Ι

The impure Colchian never there had footing.
There Sidon’s trader brought no lost of gain 3

No weary toil there anchored with Ulysses;
Sickness is known not ; on the tender lamb.

No ray falls baneful irorn one star in heaven.
When Jove’s decree alloyed the golden age,

He kept these shores sor one pure racc secretcd3
For all beside the golden age grew brass

Till the last centuries hardened to the iron,
Whence to the pure in beart a glad escape*

By favor os my prophet-strain is given.†

‘⁸ Piis¹'hasthe signification ol “pure from crime.” ‚

l It has been supposed by some that the description ol these'happy ·
islands, and the idea os migrating thither, is taken from the account ol
the Western lslands, which almost tempted Sertorius to seek in them
a refuge lrom the cares ol his lile, and the harassment os unceesing
wars. This story, which is told by Plutarch in his lile oi Sertorius, is
said by Acron to bare been given by Sallust. But the general tradi·
tion ol a happy land separated lrom the rest oi the world was popular
among the ancients from the earliest time, and Horace might bave got
the notion lrom Hesiod or Pindar. The poem, however, would assume
a much deeper and more earnest character it we could suppose that
the passage in question has a symbolical signification, and refers to tbe
isle oi happy souls in which Achilles was wed to Helen. In that case
the latent meaning would apply to another world beyond this, and its
moral would be, “ Rather than submit to the ills and ignominy in store

lor us. let us talre our chance ol those seats in Elysium reserred sor the
pure.’'
