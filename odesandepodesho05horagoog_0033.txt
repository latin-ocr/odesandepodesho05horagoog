xxii T lre Odes os Horace.

-it is the ilex upon Algidus ; and so forth, through innu-

’ merable instances. That in this peculiarity there is acharm

to me ear and the mind os the reader, no one acquainted
with Horace will deny. But whence that charm? Partly
because it gives that kind ol individuality which belongs to
personation-it takes the object out ol a boundless common-
place, and rivets the atte'ntion on a more fixed and definite
image; but principally because, while it thus limits the idea

beauty in lyrical composition may be sasely commended to
modern poets. It is noticeable that Horace has little or
