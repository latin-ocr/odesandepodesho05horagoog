Canu. VII.

Quid fles, Asterie, quern tibi candidi
Primo restituent vere Favonii
Thma merce beatum,
Constantis juvenem lide,

Gygen? Ille Notis actus ad Oricum
Post insana Caprae sidera, frigidas

Noctes non sine multis
lnsomnis lacrimis agit

· Atqui sollicitae nuntius hospitae,
Suspirare Chloen, et miseram tuis
Dicens ignibus uri,
Tentat mille valer modis.

Ut Proetum mulier perfida credulum
Falsis impulerit criminbus nimis
Casto Bellerophonti
Maturare necem, refert*

Narrat paene datum Pelea Tartaro,
Magnessam Hippolyten† dum sugit abstinens ;

Bellerophon, and lor the same reason. Acastor, like Proetus, having
scruplss oi conscience which iorbade him to slay his guest with his own
hand,J invited Peleus to hunt wild beasts in Mount Pelion; and when
Peleus, overcome with tangue, iell asleep on the mountain, nostor con·
cealed his sword, and lest him alone and unarmed to be devoured by the .
beasts. Peleus on making and searching ior his sword was attached by

Centaurs, but sared by Chiron.
