ODE XII.

neonune’s sonrnoornr.

Most oi the earlier commentators took it sor granted that
the poet is here addressing Neobule. Dillenburger‚ Orelli,
and Maeleane prefer to consider that Neobule is throughout¹

the ⁹
How unhappy the lotos poor girls; neither play to their
sancies in love,
Neither balm for their sorrows in winel l'rightened out oi
their souls by the lash
In the tongue oi some testy relation*

Neobule, winged Love has flown off with thy spindles and
baslret oi woolsl
And thy studions deligbt in the toils'of Minerva is chased

srorn thy beart
By young Hebrus, the bright Liparaean.

¹ Hardy swimmer in Tiber to plunge glearning shoulders

anointed with oill
Sure‚ Bellerophon rode not so well; as a boner no ann is
so strong;
· And no ioot is so fleet as a mnner.

Skilliul marksman when over the champaign the bounds
drive and scatter the deer,
To select the right stag ior his dart3 and as nimble to start
the wild boar,
Lurking grim in the dense forest-thicket.

. ⁴¹ Literally “uncle’' ‘⁶ Uncles,” Torrentius observes, “had consid·
erable power over their nepbews and nieces by the Roman law, and,
being less indulgent than fathers, their severity passed into a proverln”
