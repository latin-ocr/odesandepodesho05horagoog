⁶, 124 The Odcs of Horace.

ODE XXVI.

To 1„ mus ann.

Horace addresses this same Lamia again, lib. 111. Ode
xviii. Lamia must have been very young when this ode was
written, the date of which is to be guessed from the refer-
ence to Tiridates and the Parthian disturbances Assum·
ing with Orelli, Macleane, and others, that it was composed
nme. 729, just before Tiridates fled from his kingdom,
Lamia survired fifty-seven years, dying nme. 786 (Tae
Ann, vi 27).

1, the friend of the Muses, all fear and all sorrow
. Will consign to wild wind's as a height for Crete’s ocean 3
I'm the one man who feels himself safe,

Whatever king reigns at the Pole-

Whatever the cause that appais Tiridates
Muse, thou sweetener of life, haunting hill-tops Bimpleiam
Whose delight is in founts ever pure,
Weave the blooms opened most to the sun-

O weave for the brows of my Lamia the garland:
Nought my praise without thee. Let thyself and thy sisters
Make him sacred from Time by the harp
Heard at Lesbos ; but new be its strings.
