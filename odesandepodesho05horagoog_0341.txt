ODE XXIII.

m PHIDYLE.

Jani and other commentators have supposed the Phidyle '
bere addressed to be Horace’s country bousekeeper, and
that Horace in this ode answers some complaint oi hers
that her master did not permit her to sacrifice in a manner
sufficiently handsome Orelli observes that Phidyle could

not

’ Ii with each new-bom moon thou liit to Heaven thy suppli·
ant hands,
Ii with sorne grains oi frankincense, iresb corn, and flesh ol
swine‚
My rustic Phidyle, thy rites
Appease thy simple Lares,

Thy fruitsul vines shall neither feel the south wind’s poisoned
breath‚*

⁶nor mildew blight to sterni deann thy harvests n tne ear,
Nor appled autumn's sicklied airs
Inlect thy tendet weanlings.

Let victims wliose devoted blood shall tinge the Pontiff s
axe
, Pastore on show-clad Algidus, mid oak and ilex groves‚
Or, lattening sast on Alban merids,
Grow ripe lor pompous slaughter :†

But not from thee thy homely gods ask hecatombs oi sheep;
Content are they with what thou giv’st-content with rural
crowns ς

* “Pestilentem Africum,” the sirecte-Oresti. ’-
l The floclts and berds that belonged to the College oi Pontih's were
led on Algidus and the meadows ol Alba longa.
