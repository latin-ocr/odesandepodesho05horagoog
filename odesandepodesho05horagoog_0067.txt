ODE IV.
το nncws snsnos. ⁸

¹ The Lucius Sestius here addressed was the son oi the
Sestius or Sextius defended by Cicero in an oration still
' extant.

Keen winter melts in glad return of spring and soii Favonius3
And the dry keels the rollers¹ seaward draw 5
No more the pens ailure the flock, no more the hearth the
ploughman ;
Nor giint the meadows white with rime-host hoar—

Beneath the overhanging moon, now Venus leads her dances,
And comely Graces, linked with J‘ocund Nymphs‚

“ ShakewithalternatesoottheearthwhileardentVulcankindles

The ansul forge in which the Cyclops toils*

Now well becomes anointed brows to wreathe with vendant
myrtIe,
Or such rath flowers as swards, relaxing, free ;
And well becomes the votive lamb, or kid if more it please him,
. Offered to Faunus amid shadowy groves

But eil the while, with equal step, pale Death strides on
unpausing,
Knocks at the lowly shed and regal tower.
Long hopes commenced we must not add to life’s brief sum,
glad Sestius;
Even now press on thee Night and mythic ghosts,

And Pluto’s meagre hall, which gained, the wine-king’s reign
1s over-

No more the die allots the frolic crown.†

* Venus dances-Vulcan toils: ala, in spring man reawakens both to
pleasure and labor.

s 1 The Romans chose by cast oi the die the symposiarch or king oi th'e
east.
