rapidity os action, a brilliant genius in construction, devoted
to practical purposes. When he was forming a fleet he
turned the Lucrino Lake into a harborr'or a school to the
mariners by whom he afterwards defeated the tried sailors ol
Sextus Pompeius As aedile his first carewas to supply Rome
with water, restoring the Appian, Marclan, and Anienian

. aqueducts‚ and building a new one fifteen miles’ long from

the Tepula to Rome. With this utility ol purpose he com.
bined great magnificence in taste, adorning the 'city with pul>
lic buildings and statues by the' ablest artists he could find.
All these daring and splendid qualities were accompanied
by a modesty or a prudence which preserved the affection oi
the people and avoided all chance of exciting the jealousy
os Augustus. He twice refused a triumph.

The reader will observe with what ease Horace avoids all
servility in the briei homage he delicately renders to Agrip
pa, and the playfulness oi the concluding stanza would seem
to intimate a certain familiarity oi intercourse, or at all events
that there was nothing in the temper of Agrippa, two years
younger than himself, so austere as to be shoclred hythe
poet’s favorite subjects sor song. Of the poems of Varius,
to whose muse Horace refers the due celebration ol Agrippa's
deeds, only a few fragmentary lines have been preserved. '
Among these is the description os a hound, which is vigorous
and striking. The fragment has been imitated by Virgil,
whom he preceded as an epic poet. His tragedy oi “ Thyes-
tes ” seems to have survived in repute his epics, since Quintil-
ian does not mention those, while he accords to ‘⁴ Thyestes ’'
¹the high praise oi saying “that it might have stood compar·
ison with any ol the Greek dramatic master-piceos.”
