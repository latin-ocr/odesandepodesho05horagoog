. ODE XXV.

HYMN To BACCHUS.

Ol this ode Orelli says, that it belongs more properly than
any other ode of Horace to ¹the dithyrambic genus, any
closer imitation os which was denied to the language and
taste ol the Romans, as savoring of affectation or bombast
Nowhere in Horace is there more of the true lyrical enthu-

srasm:
Whither,fn11 of thee,O Bacchus,

Am Ι hurried by thy raptore, with aspirit strange possessed?

Through what forests, through what caverns?

Underneath what haunted grottoes shall my voice be heard
aloud,

Pondering words to list up Caesar ¹
To his rank ’mid starry orders, in thecouncilhalls of Jove?
O sor utterance largely sounding‚

Never yet through mouth of poet made the language of
the world!

As the slurnberless Bacchante
From the lonely mountain-ridgessstriclren still with won-
der, sees
Flash the waves of wintry Hebrus,

Sparkle snows in Thracian lowlands‚ soar barbarian Rho·
dopd,

Such my raptore, wandering guideles3,*
Now where river-mergente open, now where forest-shad-
ows close.

*¹ ¹ “‚Ut mihi devio
Rr'pos etvacuum nemus
Mirari libet‘’
Some ol the MSS. have “rupea” instead oi “ripae’' and that reading
