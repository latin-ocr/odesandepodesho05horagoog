174 Τ he Odes of Horace.

· ODE IV.
ro xawrwras arrocuvs

Xanthias Phoceus is evidently a fictitious designation.
Xanthias is a Greek name, and given by Aristophanes to
slaves ; and Phoceus characterizes the person named as a '

Phocian.

N ay, if thou lov’st thy handmaid, Xanthias, blush not:

Long since the slave Briseis, with· white beauty,

O'ermastering him who ne'er before had yielded,*
Conquered Achilles ;

So, tou, the captive form of fair Tecmessa

Conquered her captor Telamonian Ajax;

And a wronged maiden, in the midst of triumph,
Fired Agamemnon,

What time had fallen the barbarian forces
Before the might of the Thessalian victor,
' And Hector’s loss made easy to worn Hellas
¹ Troy’s mighty ruin.
How dost thou know but what thy fair-haired Phyllis '
May make thee son-in-law to splendid parents?

Doubtless she moums the wrong to race and hearth-gods
Injured, but regal. ⁴

Believe not thy beloved of birth plebeian 3
A girl so faithful, so averse from lucre,
’ Could not be born of an ignoble mother
Whom thou wouldst blush for.

That lovely face, those arms, those tapering ankles-
. N ay, in my praises never doubt mine honor:
The virtuous man, who rounds the age of forty,
Hold unsuspected.

* “Insolentem--Achili'em” l agree with Yonge in his suggestion
that ‘⁸ insolentem ‘² means “not wont to be moved.”
