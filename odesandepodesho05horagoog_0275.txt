264 · T lae Odes of Hordea.

Earth heaped above them mourns her buried monsters,

And wails her offspring, into lurid Orcus
Hurled by the heavenly bolt 5
The swiftest lires consume not AEtna, piled

Over the struggling giant 3* the winged jailer†
Ol lustsul Tityus never quits its captive3

' Thtee hundred letters hold
The ravisher Pirithous fast in hell.

Excvmus

‘⁸ Me tabidosa Volture in Apulo
Altricis extra limen Apuliae
Ludo fatigatumque somno.”

I omit in the translation the adjective Apulian (Apulo)
· applied to Vultur, because, as between Apulo in one line
and Apuliae in the next, the text is generally supposed to be
corrupt. hpudo) in the first line, is h‘pussiae) in the second; Ι

and

¹¹¹ '⁴ Nec peredit
Impositum celer ignis AEtnam.”

The fires ol AEtna, however swiltly they burst forth, oan not consume
the heap plled above Enceladus, so as ever to iree hin-onanrr.
Horace does not say who was the giant cru‘shed under AEtna. Calli-
machus says it was Enceladus, bnd also Briareus ; Pindar and AEschylua
say it was Typho'e'us 1 have lest this question in the translation aa
vague as Horace leaves it, though Ι have been compelled to talre the
license ol adding the words, “the struggling giant,” in order to pre-
venta misconception ol the meaning-such as occurs, ior instance,
in Smart, “Nor does the active tire consume AEtna, that is placed
over r't.” ·
l The vulture.
