3¹0 T lu Odcs of Horace.

ODE XV.

ott AN OLD woltun AFFECTING Yotmr.

The names in this poem are, os course, lictitious¹ and the
satire itsell is of very general application even in the present
day. lts date is undiscoverable.

Mend thy lise-it is time 3 cease such pains to be vile,
Flaunting wife of the indigent ibycus 3

Fitter fartor the grave, do not gambol with girls,
Interspersing a cloud ’mid the galaxy.

That which Pholob thy daughter may suit well enough,
In thee, hoary Chloris, is horrible θ’

’Tis'permitted to her to besiege the young rakes
In their homes, with rnuch greater propriety:

No Bacchante the timbrel excites with its dash,
Than that daughter os thine can be livelier;

And now that with Nothus she’s fallen in love,
Not a roe on the hills is more frolicsome.

What becomes thee the best is a warrn woollen dress3
Get thee fleeces from famous Luceria ;†

What become thee the least are the lute and the rose,
And the cask tippled dry with young rioters.

⁴ ‘¹ Anus cum ludit, Morti delicias lacit.”-P. Stltus

t A town in Apulia now called Lucera In its neighborhoodwaa
one ol the largest tracts os public pastureland The woods ol Luceria ·
were celebrated.
