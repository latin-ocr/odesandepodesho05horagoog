Mitscherlich says: “His own good sense will easily show
any well-bred gentleman (urbanum) that Horace here, in a
well-bred‚ gentlemanlike way, offers himself as aguest 3 in
plain words, hints that Lamia should ask him to dine.” On
which the commentator in Orelli observes, with much seel-
ing asperity: “In the whole poem there is not avestige of
this sort os gentlemanlike good-breeding, il gentlemanlike

· good-breeding it be, which it is permitted vehemently to
doubt.'’ Evidently the commentator is an Italian. A gen· Ι
tleman os that country would certainly dispute the good· r
breeding os any friend offering to drop in at dinner.

AEli, vetusto nobilis ab Lamo,
Quando et priores hinc Lamias serunt
Denominatos, et nepotum
Per memores genus omne fastos ,d

Auctore ab illo ducis originem,
Qui Formiarum moenia dicitur

Princeps et innantem Maricae
Litoribus tenuisse Lirim,†

Late tyrannus: cras foliis nemus
Multis et alga litus inutili
Demissa tempestas ab Euro
Sternet, aquae nisi fallit augur

Aunosa cornix. Dum potis, aridum
Compone lignum: cras Genium mero
Curabis et porco bimestri,
Cum famulis operum solutis.
