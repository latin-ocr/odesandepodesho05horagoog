Boot rra-ode V. 405

Tutus bos etenim rura perambulat*

Nutrit rura Ceres, almaque Faustitas,

Pacatum volitant per mare navitae,†
Culpari metuit Fides,

Nullis polluitur easta domus stupris,

Mos et lex maculosum edomuit nerant

Laudantur simili prole puerperae,
Culpam Poena premit comes.

¹ Quis Parthum paveat? quis gelidum Scythen?
Quis Germania quos horrida parturit

Fetus, incolumi Caesare? quis serae Ι ι, ,,
Bellum curet Hiberiae?

Condit quisque diem collibus in suis,
· Et vitem viduas ducit ad arbores;
Hinc ad vina redit laetus, et alteris
Te mensis adhibet deum ᾗ

Te multa prece‚.te prosequitur mero

Desuso pateris, et Laribus tuum

Miscet numen, uti Graecia Castoris
Et magni mernor Herculis

' oi Maecenas—which Macleane rightly dismisses as mere gossip. lt is

pretty clear, by these verses, either that Horace had heard oi no such
sundal, or that both he and Maecenas regarded it with contempt. A
poet oi so exquisite ataste, and so consummate a knowledge oi the
world, would not have ventured on the line, “Nullis polluitur casta
domus stupris,” ii such scandal were riie at that very time, or, at least,
ii any credit were attached to it ; ior thus the compliment would have
been turned into a bitter irony against Augustus, and a cruel insult to
Maecenas

§Literally “at his second course ;’' or rather, as we should say, “at
dasem-“alteris ιιιοιιείιη By a decree ot' the Senate, lrbations were
to be offered to Octavian atter the battle oi Actium at private tables as
wellas in public banquets, and his name to be inscribed in hymns oi
praise as those oi the gods-Dion. Cassa. r-ro 1t is to these
· national honora that Horace alludes whenever he speaks oi Augustus
as enrolled among the gods.
