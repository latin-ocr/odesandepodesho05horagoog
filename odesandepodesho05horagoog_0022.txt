had gone through the worst extremities in that bloody war.
For those panegyrics on Augustus which, in our young days,
we regarded as renegade flattery bestowed upon a man who
had destroyed the political liberties for which the poet had
fought, we accept the rational excuses which are suggested
by our own maturet knowledge of life and of the grateful

and is accepted as a necessity‘by the few. And if the pro
