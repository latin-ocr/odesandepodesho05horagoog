Horace congratulates Numida on his retum from Spain-
probably from the army with Augustus, hue. 730. Who

Sale back from Hesperia the larthest‚
Now among loving friends shares he many a brotherly kiss, '

But the portion ol Lamia is largest3
Mindful os childhood subjected to the same monarch’s*
control,
And how they both, donning the toga,
Leapt into manhood together. Let not this happy day laek

The registered mark of the Crete stone:
Be there no stint to the wineoask, be there no pause to
the feet,
Blithe in the bound os such measure
⁸ Salii on holidays dance to! Bassus shall gallantly vie

With Damalis, queen os she-topers
Toss off his cup with a swallow like the grand 'drinkers of
Thrace ;† ·

And banquets shall want not the roses, [brief.
Garlands of parsley the long-lived, garlands of lilies the

All eyes shall for Damalis languish; [winda
But yet more encircling than ivy, climbing its way as it

Ι Shall Damalis, prool to their glances,

Tuming aside from the old loves, cling root and branch
to the new.

† “Threicia amystide.” “ Amystis ” was a deep dnughr taken with·
