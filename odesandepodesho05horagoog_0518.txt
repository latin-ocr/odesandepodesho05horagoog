Epoa'a XVI. 509

Aut pars indocili melior grege; mollis et exspes
Inominata perprimat cubilia l
Vos, quinus est virtus, muliebrem tollite luctum,

Etrusca praeter et volate litora

Nos manet Oceanus circumvagus: arva, beata
Petamus arva divites et insulas 3

Reddit ubi Cererem tellus inarata quotannis,
Et imputata floret usque vinea,

Germinat et nunquam lallentis termes olivae,†
Suamque pulla ficus ornat arborem,

Mella cava manant ex ilice, montibus altis

levis crepante lympha desilit pede.
lllic injussae veniunt ad mulctra capellae,
Relertque tenta grex amicus ubera;

Nec vespertinus circumgemit ursus ovile‚‡
Neque intumescit alta viperis humus.§
Pluraque selices mirabimur: ut neque largis
Aquosus Eurus arva radat imbribus,l

interpretation, Orelli commends Jahn’s proposed construction to take
“alta'' with “intumescit”-“swells high” Macleane indorses it
Orelli refers “tumescit'' not to the sweltering venum, but to the undu·
lous movement os the reptile, alternately rising and falling, so that
the ground literally seems to heave, as the commentator in Orelli says
he has himself noticed, in his solitary wallus along the meadows and
waterbnnlrs ol Italy, which, but lor the vipers, would have been ex·
ceedingly pleasant. In the translation itis sought to render this idea,
drawn trorn the critlc's personal observation, and which, as a friend
suggests,is in curious accordance with a passage in Humboldt's “As-
pects of Nature,” where he describes the reptiles, snakes, breaking their
way through the clay soil let'l by the inundations ot the Orinoco, and
lilling the ground into little heaps Ritter finds iault with Orelli’s in·
terpretation, and contends that ‘¹ alta ’¹ denotes the high grass and herb-
age ot the soll

ll“Aquosus Eurus arva radat imbribus.” The literal and verrucular ·
meaning ol ‘¹ rado ” is “to share,” as “radere caput ;” “radere litora ’⁵
(generally construed “to coast along ”l is better interpreted by the
phrase familiar enough to our English sailor, “to share the shore.”
Orelli here construes “radat '' “deluges,” or “lays waste.”
