license ol manners-in short, the change from the calami· ’
ties of civil war to the felicity ol a govemment firm in main·
taining order, and mild enough to be popular beyond all
recorded precedent, Horace conveys his own vindication
from the charge inconsiderately made against him sor his
attachment to the empire, and his enthusiasm sor the em-
peror. And however adulatory the language he employs
may appear to modern taste, lt is no exaggerated expression
ol the common national sentiment in the times which had
exalted Augustus to a share in the honors privately as vell
as publicly pald to the gods.

Curru. V.

Divis orte bonis, optime Romulae

Custos gentis, abes jam nimium diu ;

Maturum reditum pollicitus Patrum
Sancto concilio, redi*

Lucem redde tuae, dux bone, patriae:
Inster veris enirn voltus ubi tuus
Affulsit populo, gratior it dies,

. Et soles melius nitent.

Ut mater juvenem, quem Notus invido

Flatu Carpathii trans maris aequora

Cunctantem spatio longius annuo
Dulci distinet a domo,

Votis ominibusque et precibus vocat,
Curvo nec faciem litore dimovet:
Sic desideriis icta fidelibus

Quaerit patria Caesarem.
