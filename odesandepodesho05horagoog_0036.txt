themes to which his lyre and his genius are best suited. A
man of this character, and with a very keeu susceptibility to
ridicule, would perhaps shun the expression of any feeling in
love much deeper in its sentiment, or much more devoted in
its passion, than would find sympathy with the men of the
world for whom he principally wrote. If he ever did com·
pose love-poems so eamest and glowing,1 think it doubtful
whether he would have prevailed on himself to publish them.
To a poet who so consistently seeks to inculcate moderatiori

existence. We should feel as much shame as compassion
for any wise friend of ours whom Venus iinked lastingly in
her brazen yoke to a Lydia or a Pyrrha And as an artist,

most men have loved up to the extent that Horace admits
the passion, and very few men have loved much beyond that
lirnit.

Notwithstanding the amazing pains taken by grave pro

fessors and erudite divines to ascertain the history of Hor-
