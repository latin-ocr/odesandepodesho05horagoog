Book L—Ode XX VIII. 131

ing at Matinus should talk of Neptune particularly as the

'· ‘custos T arenti! '¹
I do not see the force of this objection. Neptune was

particularly honored at Tarentum, where he is said to ¹have
had a temple, and of which his son Tams was the mythical
founder. On the coins of Tarentum Neptune is represented
as the tutelary deity. It would appear, therefore, quite nat-
ural that Neptune should be mentioned as the guardian of
Tarentum, as Fortune is elsewhere mentioned as the guardian
of Antium, without supposing that the person so referring to
the deity was in the neighborhood of the place specially
protected; while the length at which Archytas is addressed
at the commencement seems to indicate the scene as that in
which the philosopher so 'emphatically selected was buried.
Archytas himself was a Greek of Tarentum, which would

render yet more appropriate a reference to that city whoever
may be supposed to be speaking—the poem having com-

menced with the address to the shade of the great Tarentian.

Archytas was amongst the most illustrious of the ancient
worthies-a general, a statesman, a philosopher, and espe
cially a mathematician. He belonged to the Pythagorean
school,but is supposed to have founded a new sect The
alleged inventor of analytical geometry, he is said to have
originated the application of mathematics to mechanlcs, and
constructed a flying dove of wood, which was to the myths
of the ancients what Roger Bacon's brazen head is to those
of the modems. He is considered to have been a contem·
porary of Plato, and Aristotle wrote a life of him which is

' lost.

The metre is the same as in Ode vii, but I‘have not em·
ployed the same measure in the translation, thinking that
the spirit of it requires the more elegiae rhythm which I
have appropriated to some of the Epodes, and, indeed, to
some other of the Odes.
