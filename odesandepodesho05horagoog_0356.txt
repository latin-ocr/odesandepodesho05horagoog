Canu. XXVI.

Vixi puellis nuper idoneus,

Et militavi non sine gloria5
N unc arma defunctumque bello
Barbiton hic paries habebit,

Laevum marinae qui Veneris* latus
Custodit. Hic, hic ponite lucida
Funalia, et vectes, et arcus
Oppositis foribus minaces†

0 quae beatam, diva, tenes Cyprum, et
Memphin carentem Sithonia nive,
Regina, sublimi flagello
Tange Chloen semel arrogantem.
