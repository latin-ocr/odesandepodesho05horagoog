152 The Odes os Horace.

To anns some madding crowd
Rouse with the shout to which an empire salis

Thee doth untamed Necessity sor ever
Stalk heroe before 3-the ship hails and the wedges

Bearing in grasp of bronze,
Which lacks nor molten lead nor sieadsast clareio*

But thee Hope follows, and rare Faith, the white-robed,
True to thee, even when thou· thyself art altered,
And irom the homes os Power
Passest away, in mourning weeds, a foe ;

While the salse herd, the parasite, the harlot,
Shrink back: their love is dried up with the wineeask, “
Their lips reject its iees;
Their neeks will halve no yoke that Sorrow draws„

Guord Coesor, seeking on earth's verge the Brimo,—
Guord Rome’s young swarm oi warriors on the wing,

Where they oiighh to awe
The rebel East and Araby·s red sea.

Shome ior the scats, the guile, the blood oi brothers!
What hoie we shunned-we, the hard Age oi Iron?
What oi crime leh intacti
What youthiui hand hos sear oi heaven restrained?

ii'here stands an altar sacred irom its mpine?
[head guidexx—steel made blunt in impious battles
On anxiis new eeiorge3
And tum its exige on Amh and on Scyth!
