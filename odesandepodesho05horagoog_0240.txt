Book lL-Ode XIX. 229

poem is uncertain. Macleane suggests that it was perhaps
composed at the time oi the Liberalia, though in what year
there are no means of determining. From its dithyrambic
character, Orelli conjectures it to have been a copy from
some Greek poem. The mette-in this and the translation
immediately following has some slight deviations t'rom the
preceding versions of the Alcaic, but not such as to affeet
the general character and form os the rhythm.

Canu. XIX

Bacchum in remotis carmina rupibus
Vidi docentem, (credite posteri t)
Nymphasque discentes, et aures
Capripedum Satyrorum acutas.

Euoe, recenti mens trepidat metu,
Plenoque Bacchi pectore turbidum
Laetatur. Euoe, parce, Liber,

Parce, gravi metuende thyrso!

Fas pervicaces est mihi Hyiadas,
Vinique sontem, lactis et uberes
Cantare rivos, atque truncis
Lapsa cavis iterare mellay

Fas et beatae conjugis additum
Stellis honorem, tectaque Penthei
