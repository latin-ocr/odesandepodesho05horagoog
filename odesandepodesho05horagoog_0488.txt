Epode V. 479 .

Sub haec puer, jam non, ut ante, mollibus
Lenire verbis impias 3

Sed dubius unde rumperet silentium,
Misit Thyesteas preces ε*

“ Venena magnum fas nefasque non valent
Convertere humanam vicem3 ’

Diris agam vos ;† dira detestatio
Nulla expiatur victima

Quin, ubi perire jussus exspiravere,
Nocturnus occurram Furor,‡

Petamque voltus umbra curvis unguibus,
Quae vis deorum est Manium ς

Et inquietis assidens praecordiis,
Pavore somnos auferam.

Vos turba vicatim hinc et hinc saxis petens
Contundet obscoenas anus;

candor, not less than nine various interpretatione, but very decidedly
pronounces himself in favor of that which 1 believe he originales, and
which is certainly a bold one. He assumes “magnum fas nefasque '’ to
be the subject, and that the sense is, “the great law of wrong and right
(divinae leges), according to human sense (humanam vicem), can not con·
vert (sollen and· bend) witchcraft or the hearts of witches.” Macleane
says, 1 think correctly, “that if this view of the construction were adopt·
ed, it would be better to render ‘humanam vicem’ ‘on behalf of men or
of humanity.”' Macleane suggests two other interpretations (sce his
note), which appear to me more open to objection. Yonge, following ¹
Orelli in the main points, asks whether it may not be better to reverse
the order, and taire “venena '' for the nominative case-thus, “sorceries
(and those who use them) can not change (i. e.. turn aside or defeat) the
divine law, aa they can men and men's law; therefore 1 appeal rothem:
such an appeal will draw down awrath implacabl'e.” He rendcrs “hu-
manam vicem '’ ‘¹ in human fashion,” ‘⁴ after the manner of men.” 1 have
adopted the sense of this interpretation Witchcrafts is abetter word
here than sorceries, which properly signify divination by lot. Two other
interpretations have been suggested tome by eminent scholare: ist,
Witchcralt can not distort (or overthrow) 'the great rules of right and
wrong in the interest of men (taking “humanam vioem” in the sense,
“hominum causa”). ad, Witchcraft can not overthrow the great law
of wrong and right-human retribution.
t ‘⁴ Furor ’'-literally, “a personified madness.''
