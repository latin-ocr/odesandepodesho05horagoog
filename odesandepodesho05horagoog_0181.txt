ro Q. naturus.

The commentalor in Cruquius has Gellius for Dellius, ,
assuming the person addressed to be L. Gellius Poplicola,
brother oi Messalla, the famous orator. But the common
supposition is that the poem is addressed to Q. Dellius, to
whose changeful and adventurous lise its adrnonitions would
be very appropriate. Dellius sided first with Dolabella,
then went over to Cassius, then to M. Antony and Cleo-

-’ patra To Cleopatra he is said to have dictated the advice
that

With a mind undisturbed take lile's good and lile's evil,
Temper gries from despair, temper joy from vainglory ;
For, through each mortal change, equal mind,

Ο my Dellius, befits mortal-born,

Whether all that is lest thee ot' lise be but trouble,
Or, reclined at thine ease amid grassy recesses,

Thy Falernian, the choicest, records
How serenely the holidays glide.

Say, sor what do vast pine and pale poplar commingle
Friendly boughs that invite to their welcotning shadowl*
Wheresore struggles and murmurs the rill
Stayed from flight by a curve in the shore ὴ*

Thither, lo, bid them bring thee the wine and the persumes,
And the blooms of the pleasant rose dying too swiltly3

* “The oldest and best MSS. have ‘quo,' which signifies ‘to what
purpose ;’ as,‘Quo mihi fortunam, si non conceditur uti l' (Epp., 1. v.
12.) lle seems to mean, ‘What were the stream and the cool shade .
given sori Bring out the wine and let us drinlc’'’-Mat:1.ahhn.
