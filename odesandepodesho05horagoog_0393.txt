ODE 11. ,

ΤΟ lULUS ANTONIUS.

Iulus Antonius was the second son οἰ M. Antony the
triumvir by Fulvia ς the elder, Antyllus‚ was put to death by
Octavian aiter the battle of Actium. Iulus, then in his
iniancy, was brought up with great tendemess by his step
mother Octavia, married her daughter Marcella, and rose to
the highest honors of the State—prator, nnc. 7413 con-
sul, nnc. 744. His end was tragical. He was either
executed by Augustus or destroyed himself, nnc. 752, in
the sorry-second year oi his age, on the charge oi adultery
with Julia, to which crime he is said to have been induced
by ambitious designs on the Empire. Iulus possessed the
literary accomplishments ior which so many oi the Roman
nobles in that day were remarkable. He was a pupil oi L
Crassitius, a celebrated grammarian, at whose school were .
instnrcted youths of the first Roman samilies. According to
the scholiasts, he composed not only works in prose, but
twelve books in heroic verse upon Diomed, which Acron
styles “ egregios ;” though, as Macleane observes with his
customary good sense, “As it is most likely Acron never

saw
Iulus, he who would with Pindar vie,
Soars, with Daedalian art, on waxen wings,
And falling, gives his name unto the bright
Deeps of an ocean*

As from the mountain-top a headlong stream,

Nourished by rains beyond familiar banks,

So seethes, and, measureless with utterance deep,
Rushes down Pindar.
