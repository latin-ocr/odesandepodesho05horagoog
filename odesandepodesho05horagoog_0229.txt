218 The Odes of Horace. '

Why crare new suns? What exile from his country
F lies himself also?

Diseased Care* ascends the brazen galley‚

And rides amidst the armed men to the battle‚†

Fleeter than stag, arrd fleeter than, when driving

Some roods of land, some breathings‚ lowly munnured‚ ,
Of Grecian Muse, and power to scorn the mallee

Of the mean vulgar.
