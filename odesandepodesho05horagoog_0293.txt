282 The Odes os Horace.

Then seeks to allure him by tales
Teaching lessons sor sinning in sasety:

All in vain! To his words is thy true-love
Deas as rocks to the breakers Ican'an3
But keep sharp lookeut on thyself,
Lest too charmed with thy neighbor Enipeus; ,

Though no ridet so skilled and so noticed
Wheels a steed on the turs os the Campus 3*
“’ Νο swimmer so lustily cleaves

Rapid way down the stream os the Tuscan.

Make thy door fast at eve, neve'r looking
Down the street if shrill fifes serenade thee 3
And be but more rigidly cold
Whensoe'er he complains of thy coldness,

, * “Flectere equum.” This was to wheel the horse round in a small ·
circle-mactmus.
