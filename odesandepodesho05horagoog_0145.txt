134 The Odes os Horace.

Each head* must pay to Proserpine the poll-tan
Me also, N otus,† hurrying on to j0in

His comrade setting amidst storm, Orion,
Plunged into death amid Illyrian waves„

But thou, 0 sailor, churlishly begrudge not
·A sand-grain to my graveless bones and skull;

So may whatever the east wind shall threaten
To waves Hesperian, pass thee harmless by

And waste its wrath upon Venusian sorests:

So srorn all-righteous Jove and him who guards
Tarentum’s consecrated haven, Neptune,

Be every profit they can send thee showered.

Think'st thou ’tis nought to doom thy guiltless children
To dread atonement for their lather’s wrong?

N ay, on thysels may fall dire retribution
And the just laws that give back scorn sor scom.

I’ll not be lest, with prayers disdained, revengeless, ,
Νο expiation could atone such crime 3

Whate’er thy haste, this task not long delays thee-
A little dust thrice sprinkled—then away.

⁴ “Nullum saeva caput Proserpina fugit ”-in allusion to the loclr ol
hair which, according to the popular superstition, Proserpine cut off from
the head os the dying.

†,¹‘Me also, Notus,‘' ete Is the poem be supposed a dialogue, it
seems to me that this is the place at which the second speaker, as the
