350 The Odes os Horace.

“What have I done? what lestt‘ The crimes os virgins
A single death does not suffice to punish.
Am 1 awake? have 1 in truth committed

Sin, and so vilely?

’ “Or am 1 guiltless—duped by a vain phantom
Leading a dream ont of the ivery portal?
Could Ι indeed have lest for watery de‘serts

Home and the held-flowers?

“O that the bull were to my wrath delivered!

0 for a sword to hack his horns, and mangle

T he monster now so hated‚ though so lately-
Woe is me l-worshipped.

“ Shameless‚ my household gods I have sorsakem

Shameless‚ 1 loiter on the road to Oreus!

Would to the gods that 1 were in the desert
Strayed among lions!

“While in these cheeks the bloom be yet unwithered,
And all the sap os the luxuriant lise-blood
Make their prey tempting, may this fatal beauty

F east the fierce tigers.

“I hear my absent father, ‘Vile Europa,
Why pause to die? More ways than one, O eowardt
Here, at this elmtree, strangled by thy girdle‚

.' Sole friend not cast off 3

“ ‘Or there, down yonder precipice, plunge headlong
Whirled by the stonn-hlast to thy grave in ocean;
Unless,O royal-born, it please thee better,

Sold into hondage,

ι ¹¹ Unde quo γρηΰ “ ‘Unde' implies not that she was so distracted
that she had torgotten from whence she had corne, but what an exchange
1 have made.”-Mrcnannn
