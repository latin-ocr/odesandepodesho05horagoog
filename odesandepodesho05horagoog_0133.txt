122 Τ he Odes of Horace.

ODE XXV.

ΤΟ LYDlA.

Little need be said about this poem. The reader has
been already warned against the assumption that in the appli-
cation os names, evidently fictitious‚ to poerns oi this kind,
the same person is designated by the same name. Itis
obviously too absurd to suppose that the blooming Lydia
of the r3th Ode in this very Book is identical with the
saded hag lampooned in the following ode. The poem it·
sels is, with others oi the same kind, only valuable as illus·
trative oi Horace's character on its urban or town-brad side
-its combination os the man of a sashionable world when at
Rome, and os the solitary poet wrapped in his fancies, and

meditating
More rarely now shake thy closed windows
With quick knocks os petulant gallano,-

They break not thy sleep3 to thy threshold
Fondly the door clings

Once turning so glib on its hinges. ·
'lhou hear’st less and less, ‘⁸ Lydia, sleep’st thoul
'Tis I-all night long for thee dying-

Ι thine own lover l’

Now thou whin'st that this new generation

Likes but young shoots os ivy and myrtle,

And dedicatos dry leaves to Hebrus,*
Winter’s cold comrade?

¹⁵⁸: Hebro ”-a river in Thrace: aa we should say, “to the north
oo ι’
