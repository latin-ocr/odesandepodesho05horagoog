²94 Τ he Odes os Horace.

Yet, granting thy heart be not soster than oali,
Nor gentler than snakes-as a goddess, at least,
Spare the life os a suppiiant 1 I arn of flesh,

And ean bear not forever this poreh and that sleet*

¹ “Aqua Caelestis patiens! The expression mn scarcely apply to
rain, since the night has been described ae one oi wind and trost :-

⁴⁸ Glaciet nives
Puro numine Juppiter ;”

“puro ’' being, as Maeleane observes, ‘¹ an epithet weil suited to a clear,
frosty night.” The wind would keep off the snorv, but there might be
gusty showers oi sieety hail. Horace, however, no doubt, uses the ex-
pression in agenorei sense, such as the “floods os heaven,” whether
they be show, rain, or sleet.
