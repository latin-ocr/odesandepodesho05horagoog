4²4 The odes of Horace.

Whensoever an arbiter, faithful to justice,
Over what is expedient exalts what is honest,

Aves the briber with one lofty look,
And through hosts clears, victorious, his wop*

It is not large possessions themselves that are blessings3
More rightly called ‘⁶ blest,'’ he whose claim to the title
Is the wisdonr which puts to their use
nl] the gifts that'he oves to the gods,

He who hardens his soul to reverse and privation-
He who looks upon death as less dread than dishonor-
Never fears‚ for the fn'ends of his love

Or the cause of his country, to die.

⁸ The meaning of these linea seems explained by reference to Lih 111.
0d ii lines 19, 20,-
“ Nec sumit aut ponit recures
Athlula popularis aura ;”
ia, lollius is not the mere official consul of a single year-he never lays
down the insignia of his majestic virtue. lt seems to me thar the image
isatill continued through the lines,—
⁴⁸ Per munus ennena·
Explicuit rua vietor amra”
The lictors dispersed opposing crowds to maire way for the consul, and
“uma” here may signify their axes Yonge renders the passage pet ’
more symbolically‚ in this eloquent paraphraser “The soul has an inde·
pendent dignity so long as, true in principle and judgmenh ir rejects cor·
ruption, and burstr in a moral victory through the host of vioes” Ritter

insiste on construing the lines literally‚ and refers them to lollius's mili·
tary administration of his province.
