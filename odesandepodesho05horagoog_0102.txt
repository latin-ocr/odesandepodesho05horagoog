Book L-Ode XIV.

Canu. XIV.

Ο navis, referent in mare te novi
Fluctusl Ο quid agis? Fortiter occupa

Portuml Nonne vides, ut
· Nudum remigio latus?

Et malus celeri saucius Africo
Antennaeque gemant, ac sine funibus†
Vix durare carinae
Possint imperiosius

- AEquor? Non tibi sunt integra lintea,
Non di, quos iterum pressa voces malo:
Quamvis Pontica pinus,‡
Silvae filia nobilis,

Jactes et genus et nornen inutile;
Nil pictis timidus navita puppibus
Fidit Tu, nisi ventis
Debes ludibrium, cave.

Nuper sollicitum quae mihi taedium,
Nunc desiderium curaque non levis,
Interlusa nitentes
Vites aequora Cycladas.

tered ship to which they were invited, Applying the lines to the cause
ol the old Brutus party, trell might Horace exclaim, “Nuper sollicitum
quae mihi taedium‚” in reference to the anxieties and to the disgusts with
which his share in that cause had subjected him, the loss ol friends and
hopes and fortune ς and well and tendcrly might he add, in affection lor
former comrades and deprecation ol the perils they were about to risk,
‘⁴ Nunc desiderium curaque non levis.'' ‘¹ Desiderium ”is a word that im·
plies affection, and “a missing ol something-a regret” The whole ol the
poem thus construed seems to me in complete harmony with all the
poems in which Horace takes aretrospective view ol his connection
with Brutus's party, and tho attachment he retained lor his old friends,
so strongly evinced in his welcome to Pompeius Varus, Lib. ll.
