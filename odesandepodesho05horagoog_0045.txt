four-line stanzas with a suitable pause, that Mr. Yonge fol-
lows Stallbaum in printing the first two lines as prelatory
to the rest, and the last two lines as the complement of the
stanza But it is a somewhat bold proceeding, for the sake
of establishing an arbitrary system, thus to cut a stanza in
half, placing one half at the beginning and the other half at
the end of a poem ; nor does the arrangement entirely effect -

to my valued friend Dr. Kennedy. His encouragement
induced me to proceed with my undertaking, while his
advice and suggestions enabled me materially to improve it. Ι
With no less liberal a kindness another friend, the Rev.
F. W. Farrar, has permitted me to encroach on his time,
