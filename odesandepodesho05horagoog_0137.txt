126 T lu Odes os Horace.

ODE XXVII.

To Boow COMPANIONS.

In this poem, as in others of a convivial nature, Horace
transports himself as it were into the midst oi the company,
and imparts an air oi reality to an imaginary scene, so that
it seems as ii actually an impromptu.¹

Brawl and fight over cups which were born but l'or pleasure*
Is the custom in Thrace. Out on manners barbaric,
Do not put modest Bacchus to shame

By the scandal oi bloody affrays

In what strange want ol keeping with winecups and lustres
Arc the dirks οἱ the Mede. Hush that inlamous clamor,
Be quiet! Companionsl scats-scats!
Lean in peace on prest elbows again!

Do you wish me to share a Falemian so doughty?

Well then, let the young brother ol Locrian Megillo
Reveal by what wound, by what shal‘t '

He is smitten and dies-happy boy.

What, refirse? tutl I drink on no other condition,

Ι Come, no matter what Venus may conquer thee—blush not,

For we know that thy sins in that way
Must be always high-bred and refined.

Nay, thy secret is sale in these faithful ears whispered,
Hal indeed luckless wretchl whirled in what a Charybdis!
⁴ How I pity' thy struggles‚0 youth,
Ι Thou, so worthy less dismal aflamel

Ο what witch or, with potions Thessalian, what wizard-
Nay, what god could avail t'rom such coils to release thee?
From that tn'ple Chimaera's embrace
Scarce could Pegasus carry thee off.

. '¹ “Natis in usum laetitiae scyphis'' ‘⁴ Natis ”-“ born,’' as ii ntade by

nature, and destined exclusively lor that purpose—Omni.
