Book a-oa XXXVII. 157

for the soe who defrauds the victor of his triumph, and dies
a queen, that very generosity of his serves more to justisy
the joyous exultation with which the poem commences,
since it implies the detennined nature of the great enemy
from wliom Rome is delivered. The date of the poem is
sufficientiy clear. M. Tullius Cicero, son os the orator,
brought to Rome the news of the talring ol Alexandria, and
the deaths of Antony and Cleopatra, Sept, aue. 724, sug-
gesting this exhortation to private and public rejoicings. It
will be observedhere, as elsewhere, how Horace avoids nam·
ing Mark Antony. Two lines from a fragment ol Alcaeus are
‚cited by commentators to show that the commencement of
this ode is imitated from thern. They rather serve to show
with what sedulous avoidance of servility Horace does imi·
tate, and how thoroughly Roman the whole treatment os his
poem is, whatever be the lines to which a Greek poem may
fumish hint and suggestion.

Canu. XXXVII.

Nunc est bibendum, nunc pede libero
Pulsanda tellus, nunc Saliaribus*
Omare pulvinar deorum
Tempus erat dapibus, sodales.

Antehac nefas depromere Caecubum
Cellis avitis, dum Capitolio
Regina dementes ruinas,
Funus et imperio parabat

Contaminato cum grege turpium
Morbo virorum, quidlibet impotens
Sperare, fortunaque dulei
Ebria Sed minuit furorem
