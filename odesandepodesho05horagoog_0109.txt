98 T hc odes os Horace.

Be appeased then: that vehement heat of the bosom
In the sensitive heyday os youth tempted me too.
And it whitled me all frantie away
Down the torrent of scurrilous song. ¹

NowI seek to exchange rude emotions for sost ones,
Provided my penitence move thee to pardon‚
And my full recantation thus made,
Ο be friends, and restore me thy heart
