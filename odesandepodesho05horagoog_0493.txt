EPODE VII.

TO ΤΗΣ ROMANS.

This poem is referred by Orelli (who rightly oonsiders it
<torqueo at a comparatively early age) to the beginning os
the tar ol Peneia, amc. 713-14, to which period the roth
little is ascribed. Others refer it to arae. 716, the expe

dition

0 guilty! enimet, whither would ye run?

ll‘hy snords just sheathed to those right hands refitted?
ls there too little os the Latiari blood

Shed on the land or wasted on the ocean,
Not thot the Roman may eonsign to flames

The houghty baldements os envious Carthage;
Not that the intact Briton may be seen

In captim chains the Sacred Slope descending3

But that, compliant to the Parthian's prayer,

By her own right hand this great Rome shall perish?

Not so with wolves ; lions not lions rond ;

The wild beust preys not on his own wild kindred. Ι
ls it blind frenzy, or some demon Power‚*
Or willsol crime that hurries you thus headlong?

Reply l All silent ς pallor on all cheelrs

Aoo on all minds dumb consciencestricken stupor.
so is it then l so rest on Roman heads

lwttt. and the guilt os fratricidal murder,
ΕΜ situel Remus shed upon this soil

'l‘ho iturotent blood atoned sor by descendants
