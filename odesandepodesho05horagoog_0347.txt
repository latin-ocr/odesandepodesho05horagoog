, 336 T lte Odes of Horace.

No dowered shedespot rules her lord, nor trusts
The wile's protection to the leman’s splendor*

There, is the dower indeed magnificent!
Ancestral virtue, chastity unbrolren,

, Shrinking with terror lrom all love save one;
Or death the only sentence for dishonor.
Oh, whosoe'er would banish out of Rome
Intestino rage and fratricidal slaughter,

If he would have on reverent statues graved
This holy title, “ Father of his Country,'’

Let him be bold enough to strike at vice,
Curb what is now indomitable-License‚

And earn the praise ol aster time! Alas!

Virtue we hate while seen alive 3 when vanished,
We seek her—but invidiously3 and right

The virtue dead to wrong some virtue living.

But' what avails the verbiage ot' complaint- -
Το rail at guill, yet punish not the guilty?
What without morals profit empty lawsl
Is not that zone, which, as his own enclosure,

The sun belts round with fires-nor that whose soil
Is ice, the hard land bordering upon Boreas-
Scare back the avarice of insatiate trade,
And oceans are the conquests of the sailor ;

Il dread to encounter the supreme reproach
Os poverty,ordains to do and suffer

All things for profit, and desert as bare
The difficult way that only mounts to virtue?

*¹ “ Nec nitido hdit adultero.’‘ Macieaue follows Orelli in considering
that this means that she does not trust to the influente ol the adulterer
to protect her from the anger ol the husband.
