ODE XIX.

tt) obventu.

Whether Glycera and Cinara be the same person-wheth'
er the Glycera here addressed be the same Glycera as is
elsewhere

Methougnt 1 had finished with iove
When the mother herself of the Cupide, merciless mother
1111118111]ιί ssheban boy, Semele's son,
And the goddess called Wantonness bade me to love-again
render my soul.

It burns me that smoothness ol light,
Than the marble ol Paros more pure, which is shed over
Glycera’s lace-
It burne rne that dear sauey eharm,
And the look slippery·sheen to behold: he who loiters and
gazes must fall.

All Venus has rushed upon me,
Deserting her temples in Cyprus She will not permit me
Of nt? ἓοῃγεῑὴ, and the seints ol the steeds
Which the Parthians wheel round on the loe, nor of aught
which belongs not to love.

Hither, slaves, quickl an altar in haste-
Pile it up with the green living s0d; hither vervain and frank-
incense bring,
And wine winters two hate matured:

By the blood os n victim eppeased, more genlly the goddess
mny come.
