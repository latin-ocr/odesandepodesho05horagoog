ODE VI.

ΤΟ M.V1PSAN1US norum

· No public man among the partisans os Augustus is more
remarkable sor the union οἰ extraordinary talents with ex-
traordinary fortune than the Vipsanius Agrippa to whom
this ode is addressed. Sprung srorn a very obscure sami·
ly, he might have sailed in obtaining a sair career sor his
powers but sor the accident οἰ being a sellow-student with
the young Octavius at Apollonia. He thus, at the age of
twenty, became one ol the most intimate associates, and ·
one ol the most influential advisers, ol the hrture emperor
ol the world. While he was yet in youth he had achieved
the highest distinctions, and secured the most eminent sta·
tion. He had passed through the office of praetor and con·

’ sul, and established, by a series os brilliant successes, the

fame of a great general. As a naval commander he became
yet more illustriously distinguished. He constructed the
Roman navy; defeated Sextus Pompeius, then master os the
sea ,· commanded the fleet against M. Antony; and the
victory at Actium was mainly owing to his sldll. It was
soon aster that last victory that this ode is supposed to
have been written. All the honors Augustus could confer
were heaped on him 3 the emperor united him to his own
family, first by a marriage with his niece Marcella, subse
quently, yet more closely, by marriage with his daughter
Julia Fortune never deserted Agrippam the close of his
lile at the age ol fisty-one. His character seems to have beena

union ol qualities rarely found together,-sagacity os design,
rapidity

'Tis by Varius that Song, borne on pinions Homeric, ⁵
Shall exalt thy renown as the valiant and victor,
Whatsoe’er the bold soldier by land or by ocean

With thee for his leader achieved.
