460 Τ lte Epodcs of Horace.

Of brisk Apuliam in the cares of household
And of sweet children bears her joyous part3
Who on the sacred hearth the oldest fagots
Piles ’gainst the coming of her wearied lord ;
And in the wattled close the milch-idne penning,
Drains the distended udders of their load;

Or sorrei, lusty lover of green helds ;
Or mallows‚ wholesome for the laden body,
· Or lambkin slain on Terminus’ high feast,
Or kidling rescued from the wolf ’s fierce hunger.

Flock blithe from field to sold, see the tired oxen
With languid neck draw back the inverted share,
And home-bom† laborers round the shining Lares
Gathered-the faithful swarm of the rich hive !'’
Thus said the usurer Alfius, and all moneys

And, hot for mral pleasures, that day fortnight
Our would-be farrner-lends th'em out again&
