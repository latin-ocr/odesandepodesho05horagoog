Rectius vives, Licini, neque altum ·

Semper urgendo, neque, dum procellas

Cautus horrescis, nimium premendo ’
Litus iniquum.

Auream quisquis mediocritatem

Diligit, tutus caret obsoleti
Sordibus tecti, caret invidenda
Sobrius aula

Saepius ventis agitatur ingens

Pinus, et celsae graviore casu

Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos
Fulgura montes.

Sperat infestis, metuit secundis

Alteram sortem bene praeparatum

Pectus. Informes hiemes reducit
Juppiter, idem

Summovet Non, si male nunc, et olim
Sic erit: quondam cithara tacentem

Suscitat Musam, neque semper arcum ·
Tendit Apollo.
