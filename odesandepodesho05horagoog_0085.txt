The Odes osHorace.

ODE X.

To MERCURY.

The scholiast Porphyrion says this ode was taken srorn
Alcaeus, who, he asserts, and Pausanias confirms it, invented
the story about Apollo’s cows or oxen. The story is cele

brated

Mercury, thou eloquent grandson os Atlas,

Who didst the rude manners os earth's early races

First mould into form, both by gracesul Palaestra*
And by skilled language-

Oi thee will 1 sing, to great Jove and Olympus

Light herald 3-—sing thee of wreathed lute the inventor,

So cunning to hide whatsoe'er the whim took thee
Gaily to piller.

When Phoebus in wrath sought to frighten thy childhood

1t thou didst not restore the kine triclrsomely stolen,

While threatening his shasts he was robbed os his quiver;
Laughed out Apollo! ·

⁶ No English paraphrase can adequately render Palaestra, vhich was ’
especially attributed to the invention oi Hermes. It appears to have been
originally distinct from the gymnasia, and appropriated chiefly to the
haining oi the athletae in wrestling and the Pancratium. When towards
the decline of the Republic the Romans imitated the Greeks in these and
other less manly customs, they attached to their villas places sor exercise
called indiscriminately Gymnasia or Palaestrae. The meaning oi the
stanza is that Mercury taught the early races how to discipline body by
skilled exercise‚and express thought by cultivated ianguage; and 1 agree ·
with Orelli in construing “ voce ” thus, and not as song or music, whichis
rather the gift ol Apollo:
