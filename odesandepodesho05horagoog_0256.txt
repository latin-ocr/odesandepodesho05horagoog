Angustam amice pauperiem* pati
Robustus acri militia puer
Condiscat‚ et Parthos feroces
Vexet eques metuendus hasta,

Vitamque sub divo 'et trepidis agat
In rebus. Illum ex moenibus hosticis
Matrona bellantis tyranni
Prospiciens et adulta virgo

Suspiret, Eheu, ne rudis agminum
Sponsus lacessat regius asperum
Tactu leonem, quem cruenta

Per medias rapit ira caedes.

Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori :i
Mors et fugacem persequitur virum,
Nec parcit imbellis juventae
Poplitibus timidoque tergo.
