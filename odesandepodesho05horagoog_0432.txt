Book lla-Ode IX. 4² 1

Hor. Pros. At all events, it is clear that the vices imputed
to him by his personal enemy, Sulpicius Quirinus, and Vel·
leius Paterculus, the adulator of Tiberius, were not sus·
pected by Augustus, with whom, even alternis deleat by
the Sygambri, nuc. 737, he retained eminent favor and .
influence‚ and who subsequently appointed him tutor to his

grandson, Caius Caesar. If Lollius could deceive Augustus
-as to his real nature, it hasbeen shrewdly observed, that he
might well deceive Horace. The exact date of the ode is

unknown, but it has the appearance ol being written aiter
Lollius's deleat 'and recall; at all events, it was published
not long aiter it, and is therefore an evidence of Horace’s
generous desire to soothe and sustain his friend in a time oi
reverse, and, no doubt, oi unpopularity. The latter part oi
the poem is in Horace’s noblest style oi sentiment and ex-
pression. Ritter maintains that Epistles ii. and xviii, Lib.
1, are addressed to the Lollius os the ode3 but most critics
consider them to be addressed to his eldest son.

Cnrtw. IX.

Ne forte credas interitura, quae
Longe sonantem natus ad Aufidum,

Non ante volgatas per 'artes
Verba loquor socianda chordis:

Non, si priores'Maeonius tenet
Sedes Homerus, Pindaricae latent,

Ceaeque, et Alcaei minaces,
Stesichorique graves Camensae ς

Nec, si quid olim lusit Anacreon,
Delevit aetas; spirat adhuc amor,

Vivuntque commissi calores
AEoliae fidibus puellae.
