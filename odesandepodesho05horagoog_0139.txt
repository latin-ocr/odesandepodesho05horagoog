128 The Odes ιψΗοναιι.1

alterium. .

Νο ode in Horace has been more subjected than this one
to the enidite ingenuity os conflicting commentators ς nor
are the questions at issue ever likely to find a solution in
which all critics will be contented to agree.

The earlier commentators toolr sor granted that the ode

was composed as a dialogue between the ghost ol Archytas
and a voyager. The voyager, landing on the shore of Ma-
tinus, finds there the unburied bones oi Archytas, and in·
dulges in a sarcastic soliloquy‚ which ends either at verse 6,
verse 16, verse ao, or, as Macleane was once oi opinion, in
the middle oi verse ⁴15-

Two other theories have been started, by both of which
Archytas is got rid oi altogether. According to the first
theory, the moralizing voyager continues his reflectione over
the grave oi the great geometrician, till (whether at verse
15, 16, or ao) the ghost, not oi Archytas, but oi another,
whose bones are bleaching on the saud, rises up, accosts him,
, and prays to be sprinkled with the dust that may serve t'or .
burial and fit him l'or the Styx.

The second theory, lavored by Macleane, and supported
by Mr. Long, dispenses not only with Archytas, but with the
’ notion ol dialogue. According to this conjecture, the whole
poem is assigned to the ghostof a shipwrecked and unburied

man, who inoralizes over Archytas and the certainty oi death, ·

etc, till, seeing a living sailor approach, he asks sor burial.
This supposition, the simplest in itseli, and sanctioned by
great critical authorities, appears to be gaining a more gene-
