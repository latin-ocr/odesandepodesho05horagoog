362 Tha odes of Horace.

ODE XXX.

PREDlCTION OF ms OWN FUTURE TIME.

This ode appears clearly intended to be the completing

’ poem of some considerable collection of lyrical pieces,

forming in themselves an integral representation of the
idiosyncrasies of the poet in character and in'genius, thus
becoming his memorial or “monumentum'’ Itis therefore
generally regarded as the epilogue, not to the Third Book
only, but to all the first three books 3 after the publication of
which, Horace made a considerable pause before he publish-
ed the Fourth. There is a great difference in tone between
this and Ode xx. Book 11, addressed to Maecenas. That ode,
half sportive,·half eamest‚ seems written in the effervescence
of animal spirits, and might have been called forth in any
moment of brilliant success. But this is written in dignified

and '

Ι have built a monument than bronze more 'lasting
’ Soaring more high than regal pyramids,
Which nor the stealthy gnawing of the raindrop‚
Nor the vain rush of Boreas shall destroy;
Nor shall it pass away with the unnumbered
Series of ages and the flight of time.
1 shall not wholly die! From Libitina*
A part, yea, much, of mine own self escapes.
Renewing bloom from praise in after ages,
My growth through time shall be to fresher youth,
Long as the High·Priest, with the Silent Virgin,
Ascends the sacred Capitol of Rome.† ’ ’
