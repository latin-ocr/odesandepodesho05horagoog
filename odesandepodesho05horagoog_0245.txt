2 34 The odes os Horace.

Than the swist son os Daedalus swister I travel.
1 shall visit shores loud with the boom of the Euxine,

And tields Hyperbordan and African sands,
And whereirer Iwander shall sing as a bird.

Me the Colchians shall know, me the Dacian* dissembling
. His dismay at the might of his victor the Roman;
Me Scythia’s far son ;-learned students in me
snm n'e spain’s rugged cnud ana ne annin os

Rhone.†

Not sor me raise the death-dirge, mine um shall be empty 3t
Hush the vain ceremonial oi groans that degrade me,
And waste not the honors ye pay to the dead
On a tomb in whose silence 1 shall not repose.

⁸ “Et qui dissimulat metum
Marsae cohortis Dacus’'

The Marsian infantry was the flower oi the Roman armies, and the Mar·
sian here represents the might oi Rome. Either the interruption to the
rapidity oi the werse by the allusion to the Dacian’s haughty dissimula·
tion ol the terror with which he regards the Roman arrns must be con·
sidered, as it has been considered by critics, one oi those ‘⁸ impertinences,”
lor the sake oi a popular hit, which is noticed in the preliminary essay as
a deiect in Horace, or it may possibly escape that reproach, and, per·
tinently to the purpose os the poem, mean that whatever the disguised ·
terror in which the Dacian holds the Roman soldier, he will welcome the
Roman poet
t “Me peritus
Discet Hiber, Rhodanique potor.’' ·

“ Peritus Hiber ” does not mean “the learned Spaniard,” as it is com·
monly translated The adjective applies, as in similar cases is habitual
with Horace, both to “ Hiber ’² and ‘⁴ Rhodani potor 5⁸¹ and as Dillen·
burget, Orelli, and Macleane agree, the meaning is, “that these barbaric
nations will bermeversed in me.” Macleane thinks that by ‘¹ Hiber ”
is probably meant the Caucasian people oi that n'ame3 Isollow, how·
ever, the interpretation popularly accepted—and sanctioned by Orelli
-that “ Hiber ” means “the Spaniard'’ The ‘⁴ Drinker oi Rhone ” is
the Gaul.
