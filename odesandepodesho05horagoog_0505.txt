496 The Epodes of Horace.

Broach the casir which was bom with mysell in the year
Os the Consul Torquatus* All else be unsaid3
F or, perchance‚ by some turn in our fortunes,a god Ι

May all else to their place in times brighter restore
Now let nard Achaemenian allord us its balm 3
Doubt and dread let the chords of Cyllene† dispe13
Listen all to the song which the Centaur renowned
Sang os old to the ears ol his great foster-son :-
¹⁸ Boy invincible‚ goddess-born, mortal thyselit
The domain ol Assaracus waits thee asar3
There the pettyl Scamander's cold streams cut their way,
And there slidingly lapses the smooth Simois
From that land, by the certain decree of their wool,
Have the Weavers oi Doom broken off thy retum,
And thy mother, the blueeyed shall never again
sear thee back o'er the path other scas to thy home
But when there, let each burden ol evils ordained,
From thy bosom be liited by wine and by song ;
Soothers they oi a converso so sweetit can charm
All the cares which deform our existence away.'’

θ “Tu uina Torquato,”etc llere he addresses himself to the master
ol the least. Sextus Manlius Torquatus was consul nuc. 689. the year

Ἡ· Fide Cyllenea,”-via, the lyre‚ invented by Mercury, bom on
Mount Cyllene, in Arcadia. There seems to me much beauty in the
choico ol the word, which introduces an image oi Arcadian freedom from
cure-the ideal holiday lile. ·

l llltter supposes that the Scamander is here emphatically called
small (parvi Scamandri flumina) antithetically to “grandi alumno ”- ·
tho great hero who found the scene oi his actions by a stream so small
tihould thie conjecture, exquisitely critical, ii not too refined, be ad-
mitted. then “lubricus et Simois ” must form a part oi the antithesis
luslumted ς ie.. actions so great beside a stream so small-actions so
lohoruem end ol renown so lond, beside astream so smootb.
