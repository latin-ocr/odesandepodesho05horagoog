'ste Odes of Horace.

Lest not unsung be Liber, bold in battle;

Nor she, the bruteworld'sioe-virgin Diana3

Nor thou, dread Lord oi the unerring arrow,
Phoebus Apollo?

Sing let me, too, the demigod Alcides,

And Leda’s twins, the rider and the athlete-

At whose joint star, what time on sturm-beat seamen
Davvns its white splendor,

Baclr irorn the rocks recedes the rush ol waters,
Wihds sall-clouds ily-and every threateuing billow,
Lulled at their will, upon the breast oi ocean

Sinks into slumber.

Should, niter these, be Romulus first honored,
Numa's calm reign, or Tarquin’s haughty fasces?
1 pause in doubt, or is it rather Cato's

N oble seli-slaughter?

Regulus, and the Scauri* and AErnilius

Lavish os his great life when Carthago triumphed,

Grateiul 1 name sor song’s most signal honors 3-
Thee, t00, Fabricius 3

He and rude unkempt Curius and Camillus,-

These were the rnen whom hardy thriit, rude nurture,

The ancestral farm, and unluxurious hornestead
Fitted ior variare.

Trea-like grows up through unperceived increases
Marcellus'† farne. As the moon throned in heaven
'Mid lesser lights, the Julian constellation

Shines out resplendent.

*¹ Either the Scauri enjoyed at that time a higher reputation than they
have retained in history, or Horace had sorne special reason, persona] or
political, now inexplicable, ior placing them in the rank ot Rome’s t'ore·

rnost worthies AEmilius Paulus, having advised the disastrous battle
