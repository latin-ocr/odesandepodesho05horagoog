ODE V.

TO AUGUSTUS, ΤΗΑΤ ΗΕ woutn HASTEN ms RETURN
TO ROME.

This ode, which Dillenburger rightly calls “dulcissimum
carmen,” may be taken in connection with the preceding
and with Ode xiv. It was composed during the absence
of Augustus in Germany and Gaul, and aller the victories
of Tiberius and Drusus. Augustus had been absent from -
September nme. 738 to February 741. In the description
of the blessings ascribed to the reign of Augustus, the se
curlty to life and property, the reformation of the previous

license
Best guardian of the race of Romulus,
And sprung thyself from deities benign,
Absent too long, fulfill thy promise, pledged
To Rome's high coum-return.

Brfng to thy country back, betovod chief,

The light: thy looks are to thy people Spring,

And where they smile‚ more grateful glides the day,
More genial shines the sun.

As the fond mother with all passionate prayers

Calls back the son rnore than one year away,

By adverse winds beyond Carpathian seas
Kept from sweet home asar,

F lxing intent upon the curving shore
The unmoving stillness of her wistful eyes 3-
So for her Caesar‚ smit with faithful love,

llis country looks and pines.
