xx The Odes of Horace.

his hands might have uttered the substance oi it in prose.
Imay perhaps enable the general reader to comprehend
more clearly what I mean by Horace’s art in diction, as
starting from the conversational tone,- and, save on rare oc·
casions, avoiding a style antagonistic to prose, by a reference

ι to the two loveliest‚ most elaborate, and most perfect lyrics

in our own language-“ L'Allegro ” and “ ll Penseroso.” In
these odes Milton takes sor representation the two types oi
temperament under which mankind are more or less divisibly

as any Latin author is3 and Idoubt whether even in England therebe
