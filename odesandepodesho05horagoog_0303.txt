ODE X.

ΤΟ ΗΕΒ.

This humorous ode belongs to akind os serenade com-
.mon enough with the Greeks, and is probably imitated from
a Greek original. There is no reason for supposing the
Lyce whose cruelty is here complained os, to be identical

with the Lyce who is lampooned in Book 1v. Ode xiii

Didst thou drink the iced water ol uttermost Don,

O' Lyce! of some cruel savage the spouse‚

Still, thy heart with compassion might think os me stretched
Where the north winds are quartered outside ol thy door.

Hark! the hinge of thy gale ; harkl the piants in thy hall,l

’ With what dissonant howl they re-echo the blasts,

And, oh! how the chaste congelation of air
Adds a yet purer coating of trost to the snow!

Lay the haughtiness hateful to Venus aside,
Lest the whe'el should run back and the rope should be
snapped‚†
'my good Tyrrhena father ne’er meant to beget
A Penelope cruel to suitors in thee.

Ah! although thou art proof against preseuts and prayerS‚
And the pale-blue complexion of lovers disdained;
Nor ev'n bowed to revenge on the spouse led astray

By a roving Pierianss less chaste than a Muse 3

* “Nemus Inter pulchra satum tecta.” Small trees were sometimes
planted round the impluvium ota Roman house. This is the interpre-
tation adopted by Orelli. Ritter contends that the line refers to one os
the two sacred grovcs situatcd between the two heights ol the Capitoline.
