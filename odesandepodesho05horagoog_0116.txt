generally believed to be the Quinctilius Varus ior whose · ,

death Horace seeks to console virgil, Ode xxiv. of this
Boolc

By the way in which Bacchus and Venus are here ad-
dressed, Horace implies a temperate and elegant convivi-
ality3 Bacchus is hailed as father, benignant, not cruel ;
and Venus as “ decens ”-that is, accompanied with the
Graces, “ipsa decens est, cum comites siut decentes Gra-
tiae (Carm. i. 4, 63 Dillenburger),· and the poet proceeds to
contrast a Bacchus and a Venus so characterised with the
brawl and lust of the Centaurs, who, invited to the marriage-
feast of Peirithous, King oi the Lapithae, attempted in their
drunkenness to carry off the bride and the other women,
which oi course led to a light with the Lapithae and with
the Sithonians, a people ln Thrace, who were afflicted by'
Bacchus with the curse os never drinking without fighting.

Cum Ias atque nefas exiguo fine libidinum
Discemnnt avidi. Non ego te, candide Bassareu*
Invitum quatiam, nec variis obsita frondibus
