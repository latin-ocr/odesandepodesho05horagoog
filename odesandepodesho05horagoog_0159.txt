148 ,T be Odes os Horace. Ι

Wherewith the fixed earth and the vagrant streams-
Wherewffth the Styx and horror-breathing realms

Of rayless Taenarus, shook- ·

Shook the world's end on Atlas. A god reigns,

Potent the high with low to interchange, Α
Bid bright orbs wane, and those obscure come forth :
Shrillingly. Fortune swoops—

Here snatches‚ there exultant drops, a crown.
