critic, who said, “ Yon are too prolir:'' “I had not time to
be shorter.’'

We know from Horace himself that he bestowed upon
his anist-work an artist’s labor—“Operosa cannina lingo.''
He seems to have so meditated upon the subject he chooses
as to be able to grasp it readily. There is no wandering
aller ideas-no seeking0to prolong and over-adom the main Ι
purpose lor which he writes. 1t it be but a votive inscrip

which very poetical critics would assign to lyrical rapture are
to be ascribed ; but it is a fault on the right side.

The next and much more important characteristic ol
Horace as a lyrical artist is commonly exhibited in his
grander odes, and often in his lighter ones3 and to this 1

athletic young Roman noble-his achievements in horse-
manship, swimrning, gymnastics; when} in the next ode, he
calls on the Feastmaster to heap up the lagon, and bring
out the wine, and enjoy his youth while he may, he slirles
