Book JJL-Ode XIII. 305

Venusia (Dillenburger‚ Orelli, Macleane). If so, it is con-
jectured that the poem would have been written in earlier
· lise, when Horace revisited his native spot-perhaps nuc.
717—since it is held scarcely probable that he would have
thought of consecrating the sountain in Venusia, when he
was settled iu the remote district of hIs Sabine sarm. lt
may, however, be likely enough, as Tate contends (Horat.
Restit p. 88), that Horace transferred the name, endeared
to him by early associati0n‚ to the spring near his later home.
ange suggests the query‚ ‘¹ Was Bandusia the name oi the
place, or of the presiding nymph of the sountain?''-See
Orelli’s sull and very elegant note on this subject

CARM. XIII.

· O sons Bandusiae, splendidior vitro,
Dulci digne mero non sine floribus,
Cras donaberis haedo,
Cui ‚frons turgida cornibus

Primis et venerem et proelia destinat ς
Frustra: nam gelidos inficiet tibi
Rubro sanguine rivos
Lascivi suboles gregis.

Te flagrantis atrox hora Caniculae
Nescit tangere ; tu frigus amabile
Fessis vomere tauris
Praebes‚ et pecori vago.

F ies nobilium tu quoque fontium,
Me dicente cavis impositam ilicem
Saris,l unde loquaces
Lymphae desiliunt tuae.
