ODE Vl.

ΟΝ ‘rtis soclnt. CORRUP'I'ION OF THE ultra.

Macleane observes that, “As theformer (five) odes are
addressed more to qualities of young men, this refers more
especially to the vices of young women, and so Horace dis·
charges the promise with which this series of odes begins?
To me,on the contrary, it is precisely because of the lines
which· so freely describe the vices of young women, single
and married, that I hesitate to class this ode among those
to which the introductory verse of the first ode applies. Let '
any man consider if a poet, as the Muse’s priest, could have

addressed,

Roman, the sins thy fathers have committed,
From thee, though guiltless, shall exact atonement,
Till tottering lanes* aud temples be restored,
And smoke-grimed† statues of neglected gods.

Thou rul'st by being to the gods subjected,
To this each deed’s conception and completion
Refer 3 full many an ill the gods contemned -
Have showered upon this sorrowing Italy.

Twiee have Monaeses‡ and the Parthian riders
Of Pacorus crushed our evilomened onslaught,
And to their puny torques smiled to add
The spoils of armor stripped from Roman breasts.

* The restoration of the temples and lanes decayed by time, or bumed
down in the civil wars, was among the chief reforms of Augustus.—
Suet, Oct xxm

†“Smoke·grimed,”-partly by conflagrations commemorated by
Tacitus and Suetonius, partly by the fumes from the sacrifices Stated
times for the washing of the statues, with solemn rites‚ were appointed.
