208 Τ lze Odes of Horace.

· But the death most to sear is the death we least look for— '

. Ahl how near was I seeing darlr Proserpine's kingdom,
And the Judge of the Dead and the Seats¹ of the Blest‚
Sappho walling melodious of loves unretumed}l

Ay, and thee, too, with strains sounding larger, Aloeus,

To thy golden shell chantlng ol hardships in shipwreck,
And ol hardshlps in exile, and hardships in war,

While the Shadows admiringly hearken to both3 ,

Due to either is silence as hushed as in temples,

But more presses the phantom mob‚ shoulder on shoulder‚
Drinking into rapt ears the grand song, when it swells

η With the burthen of battles and tyrants o’erthrown.

What wonder? since, spelled by the voice os the charmer,
The dark hell-dog his hundred heads sawningly croucheS,
And the serpents that ,unthe interweaved in the locks

Os the Furies, repose upon terrible brows3

And Prometheus himself and the Father oi Pelops,
By the dulcet delight are beguiled from their turture,

While the hand of Orion the arrow lets fall,
And the spectres of lions unheeded flit on. ·
