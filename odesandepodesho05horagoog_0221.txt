ODE XIV.

‘ro Possumus.

Who this Postumus may have been is, in spite os the
various conjectures of various commentators, as uncertain
as, happily, it is immaterial. It is, at all events, au agree
able supposition that he may be identical with the Postumus

whom
Postumus, Postumus, the years glide by us,
Alast no piety delays the wrinkles,
Nor old age imminent, -

Nor the indomitable hand of Death

Though thrice each day a hecatomb were offered,
Friend, thou couldst sosten not the tearless Pluto,

⁴ Encoiling Tityus vast,
And Geryon, triple giant, with sad waves-

Waves over which we all os us must voyage,
All whosoe'er the fruits os earth have tasted;
Whether that earth we ruled

As kings, or served as drudges oi its soil.

Vainly we shun Mars and the gory battle,
Vainly the Hadrian hoarse with stormy breakers,
Vainly, each autumn's fall,
The sicklied airs through which the south wind soils*

Still the dull-winding ooze oi slow Cocytus,
The ill-iamed Danaids, and, to task that ends not
Sentenced, AEolides ;

These are the sights on which we all must gaze.

· “ Auster,'’ ‘¹ the sirocco.‘’
