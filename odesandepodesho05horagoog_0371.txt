. 360 The Odes of Horace.

Loosed cmgs, uprooted trees,
And herds and flocks, and the lost homes of men,

While neighboring forests, and iar mountain-pestis
Mingle their roar. Happy' indeed is he,
Lord of himself, to whom
’Tis given to say, as each day ends, “I have lived :''

somorrow let the Sire invest the heaven
With darkest cloud or “ purest ray serene,”
¹ He rnars not what has been,
Nor lrom Time’s surn blots out one fleeted hout.

Fortune‚ exulting in her eruel task-
Consistent in her inconsistent sport-
Shifts savors to and fro,
Now to mysell now to another kind.

, Ι praise her seated by me ;† if she shake

Her parting wings 1 give back what she gave,
And, in my virtue wrapped,
Make honest Poverty my dowerless bride.

'Tis notior me, when groans the mast beneath
Fierce Africus, to gasp out piteous prayers,
And bargain with the gods,
Lest gainlul bales from Cyprus or l‘rom Tyre

= Add to the treasures ol the greedy deep ς
Then from the wreclr my siender boatss the gale

And the Twin star shall speed‚
Sale with one· rower through AEgaean storms. ·

the end ol the ode—a cottstruction which, Isuspect, lew critics will be in·
clined to lavor.
