422 T he Odes os Horace.

Spartan Helen was not the sole woman inflamed by
An adulterer’s sleek locks ; or seduced by the glitter
Ol the vestments embroidered in gold,

And the graces and pomp oi a prince;

’ Teucer bent not the first skillsul bow os the Cretan ;
Troy was more than once harassed by valiant besiegers 3
Other chieis, besides Sthenelus strong,
Or Idomeneus mighty, achieved

Deeds as worthy as theirs os a muse to record them ;
Not the first was Deiphobus keen, or herce Hector,
Who has met, without flinching, the blow‚
In defense oshis children and wile.

Many brave men have lived long before Agamemnon,
But o’er them darldy presses the slumber etemal 3
All unwept and unknown, wanting Him-
Everlastingly sacred-the Bard!

Little differs worth hidden from worthlessness buried ;
In the page I shall speak, and the page shall adom thee 3

Fade in livid oblivion away.

In thy mind thou coaninest liie's practical knowledge,
And a temper unmoved by the changes of fortune*
Whatsoever her smile or ber frown,
Neither bowed nor elate‚-⁵·but erect 3

The avenger of greedy and fraudsul Corruption,
The abstainer from Gold, which draws all to its magnet-
Consul not of the one year alone,
For thy mind must be always in power

θ “Secundis
Temporibus dubiisque rectus.”
