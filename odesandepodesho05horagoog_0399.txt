388 The Odes of Horace.

His frontal imitates the curvcd glearn
Os the young moon in her third night ;—all else
of tawny color, on that front os snow

Shimmers her signet*

⁸ The conclusion ol the ode has been, plausibly enough, blamed lor
a discrepancy amounting to bathos between the gravity and elevation ol
the preceding scanzae, and the lamiliar details ol the steerling to be
sacrificed-“ Desinit in vitulum mulier formosa supeme” (Srrtrrcnrr).
Orelli, on the contrary, thinlrs it conformable to poetic art, that the
height os enthusiasm should subside, as it were, in the placid anticipa-
donor the destined sacrifice Possibly Horace meant also, in descn'h
ing the animal so minutely as already reserved lor the sacrifice, to imply
how eagerly expected was the return ol Augustus ;—the victims were
already marked, the preparatione already made.
