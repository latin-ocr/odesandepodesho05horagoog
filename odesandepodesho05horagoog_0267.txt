256 The odes os Horace.

ODE IV.
rnvocnrrorr ro cnnnronn.

Itis observable thatin this ode as well asin the last, and
in Odes v. and vi.‚ composed lor political purposes, Horace
indulges rnuch more in the flights and fancies and seeming
digressions proper to poetry purely lyrical than in Odes i.
and ii, in which, inculcating moral or noble sentiments
applicable to rnen ol all parties,‚h‘e is earnestly didactic.
But treatlng political subjects, on which rnen’s minds were
divided‚ he shows wonderful delicacy of art in conveying
his purpose through forms ol poetry least likely to offend.
In Ode iii, dissuading from the projectos a settlement
in Troy, itis nothe that speaks, it is Juno. In Ode iv,
desiring to inrply that the ascendeney of Augustus is the
intellectual and godlilre mastery over irrational soree, he

begins

Descend,O Queen Calliope, from heaven,

And on thy file discourse in lengthened music ξ’

Or lov’st thou more the lyre
By Phoebus strung; or thrill of vocal song?

Hear ye, or doth the sweet delirium fool me?
1 seern to hear her, and with her to wander
Where gentle winds and waves
Steal their solt entrance into hallowed groves.

Me, when a child, upon the slopes ol Vultur
Strayed‚ truant, from my nurse Apulia’s threshold,†
And tired with play and sleep‚
Did mythic doves with budding leaves bestrew3

,u ‘¹ longum-melos.”

‘¹ ln notes, with many a windlng bont
Ol linked sweetness, long drawn συθ-Βίκταν.

Macleane says “ longum ” means a sustained and stately song. Yonge
observes, that though it may be so translated, it is enough to understand
