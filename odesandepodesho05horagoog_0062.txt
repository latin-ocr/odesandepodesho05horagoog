Book L-Ode II. .

Heu! nimis longo satiate ludo,

Quem juvat clamor galeaeque leves,

Acer et Mauri peditis* cruentum
Voltus in hostem ς

Sive mutata† juvenem figura

Ales in terris imitaris, almae

Filius Maiae, patiens vocari ·
Caesaris ultor ι

Serus in caelum redeas, diuque

laetus intersis populo Quirini,

Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum
Ocior aura

Tollat 3 hic magnos potius triumphos,

Hic ames dici Pater atque PrincepS,

Neu sinas Medos equitare inuitos,
Te duce, Caesari

by his effigies in gerris, the resemblance oi the young Octavius to the
hee oi Mercury in the statues is sufficiently striking to have created
general remark, and to save from extravagant flattery the lines in the
ode. For oi the two taces that oi the young Octavius is oi a higher
and more godiike type oi beauty than appears in any extant statue oi
Mercury.

t “sse way in which he introduces the name oi Caesar unexpectedly
at the end, hae always appeared to me an instance oi consummate
art’'-Mrcr.rrrrrr.
