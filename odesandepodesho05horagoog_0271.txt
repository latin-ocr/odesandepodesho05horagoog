260 T lte Odes of Horace.

High Caesar, seeking to conclude his labors,
Settling ln peacet'ul towns war-wearied cohorts,*
' Ye solace and resresh
In the Pierian grotto's placid shade.

Ye are the natural givers of mild counscl,
Your joy to give it, ye yourselves so gentle ll
ssWe know how He, whose law
Tempers the sluggish earth and windy sea,

He who, the Sole One, rules with tranquil justice
The 'stablished states—the varying crowd ol mortals,
· Gods, and the Ghastly Realms—

Smote with prone bolt the Titans' impious crew,

And banded giants towcring into battle:
That horrid youth in strength of arm confiding—
Brethren who sought to pile
Pelion on dun OlympuS, and to Jove

- * “Militia simul
Fessas cohortes addidit oppidis¹¹

The MSS. vary in the reading—¹⁸ addidit,’‘ “abdidit‘’ and ‘⁴ reddidit.”
Diilenburger prefers “abdidit” which the scholiasta explain as being
· sent to winter quarters Orelli powerlully contends lor ‘'addidit” as
significant oi new towns or colonies, in lavor oi which he cites Tacitus,
Ann xiii 31, ‘⁴ Coloniae Capua atque Nuceria additis veteranis firmatae
sunt.” Alter the conquestos the Salassi, a people ol the Gaulish Alps
(aue 729), Augustus assigned their territory to the Praetorian troops,
who built Augusta Praetoria (Austa). To other troops were assigned
landa in Lusitania, Augusta Emerita (Merida). Macleane agrees with
Orelli. The true reading being, however, uncertain, l have lest it equal-
ly vague in the translation l may observe, however, that as Macleane,
in common with other eminent commentators, considers this ode written
between auc 725 and 728, the line can not reier to the new towns in the
territory taken lrorn the Salassi, athe. 729

l “Vos lene consilium et datis, et dato
Gaudetis, almae.'’

“Ye give peacelul counscl, and rejoice in giving it because ye are gen·
tle.’'—Mnctnnua
