have laid down ior myseli, and adopt, modify, or reject thern
'according to his own idiosynerasies of ear and taste. ·

So far as these translations are concerned, it will be seen
that 1 have shunned any attempt to transferte our own lan·
guage the exact form of the original merres. I have rather
sought to construet measures in accordance with the charac-
ter of English prosody‚ alrin to the prevalent spirit of the
original, and of eompass sufficient to allow a general ad·
herenee to the rule of translating line by line, or at least
strophe by strophe, without needless amplification on the
one hand, or harsh 'contractiori on the other.

With regard to the rhythmical form in which a sufficient
analogy with the Latin metre can ‚be best obtained by the
English, there will always be a difference of taste and
opinion. My own plan, when 1 originally commenced these
translations, was in the first instance to attempt a close imi·
tation of the ancient measure, the scansion being of course
(as in English or German hexameters and pentameters) by
accent, not quantity-and then to make such modificatione
ol llow and eadence as seemed to me best to harmoniae the
rhythm to the English ear, while preserving as much as pos·
sible that which has been called “ the type '' of the original.
But as there are more ways than one by which such modili-
eations may attain the obieets required, so it soon appeared

to me best to vary the modifications according as the preva- , ’
“ lent spirit of the ode demanded lively and sportive, or serious

and dignified, expression.

Inthe Aleaic stanza I have thus employed two different
forms of rhythm 3 the one, which isos more frequent recur-
renee, as in Ode ix.-the other, as in Odes xxxiv, xxxv,
Book Ι. ; either ol which admits of slight occasional varia-
tions without disturbanee to the general character or “ type '³
of the measure.

For the Sapphic metro, in which Horace has composed
more odes than in any other except the Alealc‚1 have
