454 Τ he Epodes os Horace.

· Not tlrat her presence could avail sor succor,
Albeit she felt them underneath her wing.
Gladly in this oi any war a soldier

Would 1 enlist, lor hope ol thy dear grace 3
Not that, attached by ampler teams oi oxen,

My ploughs may smrggle through the stubbom glebe-
Not that my hoelis should, ere the dog-star parcheth,

Change hot Calabria ior Lucanian slopes*-

Not that sor me some villa's pomp oi marble
Should shine down white upon luxuriant vales,

⁸ Touching the walls with which the son oi Circe†
Girded enchanted land in Tusculum.

Enough, and more than I can need, lor riches,
Thanks to thy bounty, is already mine;

I am no Chremes, hoarding gold to buryl-
No loose·robed spendthrift lusting gold to waste.

¹ The wealthy proprietors sent their lloclrs in summer lrom the hot
Calabrian plains to the wooded hills ol Lucania.

t Telegonus, son oi Circe by Ulysses, said to have founded ancient
Tusculum on the summit os the hill, the slope ol which is occupied by
the modern Frascati, and to heve there introduced the magicam ol his
mother. The lines in the original are slightly paraphrased in the uane-

lation, in order not tolose to the English reader the poetic idea associ- ·

ating Tusculum with legendary enchantment, which the words “Circaea
moenia” would have conueyed to the Latin.

t '“Chremes' The allusion is, perhaps, to a character in some play
ol Menander.”-Mrcnmun
