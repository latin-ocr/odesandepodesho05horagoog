ODE X.

TO LlClNlUS.

Licinius Murena was the son of the Murena whom Cice-
ro defended, subsequently adopted by A. Terentius Varro.
He was then called A. Terentius Varro Murena Maecenas
married his sister3 and Horace speaks of him subsequently
(C. iii. 19) as one of the College of Augurs. The caution
to discretiori and moderatiori contained in this ode has a

melancholy

Licinius, wouldst thou steer life’s wiser voyage, ⁴

Neither launch always into deep mid-waters,

Nor hug the shores, and, shrinking from the tempest,
Hazard the quicksand.

He who elects the golden mean of fortune,

Nor where dull squalor rots the time-worn hovel,

Nor where tierce envy storms the new-built palace,
*Makes his safe dwelling.

' .The wildest winds rock most the loftiest prne· trees,
Ι The heaviest crash' rs that of falling towers,
The spots on earth most strichen by the lightning
Are rts high places.

The mind well trained to eope with either fortune,
Takes hope in adverse things and fear in prosperous.

Deforming winters are restored or banished
By the same F ather.

If today frown, not therefore frowns tomorrow.

His deadly bow not always bends Apollo,

His hand at times the silent muse awalrens
With the sweet harpstring.
