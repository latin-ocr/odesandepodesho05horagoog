316 Tlae odes of Horace,

ODE XVII.

ΤΟ 1,. AEulus marth.

This personage was the son ol the L. AE. Lamia who sup
ported Cicero in the suppression os the Catiline conspiracy,
and appears during the civil wars to have espoused the party
,ol Caesar. Horace's'lriend was consul nn. 35 asterwards
appointed by Tiberius governor ol Syria, but not allowed to
enter on the administration of the province. He became,

nn.

Noble AElius‚ whose house harh its rise in that Lamus
From whom both the first and the later descendants
(As attesting memorials* record)
The great name of Lamia inherit,

Thou canst trace back, indeed, to an absolute monarch‚

Holding sway, it is said, over Fonnia's walled ramparts,
And the waters ol Liris, that flow
Into grassy domains of Marica.

Tomorrow the east wind shall send us a tempest,
Which—if true be the crow, that old seer ol loul weather-
Shall strew in the grove many leaves;
On the shore‚† many profitless sea-weeds.

While thou canat, then, protect from the rains the dry
s ots;
Spend ῖῗῐηοπονι in testing thysels and thy household3
F east thy genius with wine-but not mixed 3
And do not forget a young porker.

⁴ “Per memores-fastos” “l'arnily records,” not the “lasti con·
suares.”-Mncraana

³ i The shore os Minturna, on the borders ol Latium and Campania,
where the nymph Marica was worshipped ,
