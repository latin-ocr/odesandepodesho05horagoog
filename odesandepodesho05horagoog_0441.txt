430 The Odes os Horace.

ODE XII.

INVITATION ΤΟ VIRGIL.

It is a vexed question among commentators whether the
Virgil here addressed be'Virgil the poet Yonge says that
the general authority oi critics is against that identification.
Macleaue is disposcd to favor it, and it is not without other
and very eminent deienders.

The main objections to the assumption are-rst, the
chronological one. Virgil was dead many years before the
¹publication oi the Fourth Book, but, in answer to this, it is
said that, in making up the collection composed for Book
1v., Horace might have included poems composed at a
much earlier date. Dillenburger considers that this ode was
written in youth, and published ip the final book ol the
Odes, as ii Horace wished to resresh and record the mem-
ory oi his friend.

ad, It is asked, “ How can Virgil the poet be'called me
client os noble youths ?’' To this it has been replied, that
the youths referred to might be the stepsons of Augustus, or
(more generally by Dillenburger), that the phrase means
nothing more than me familiarity with persons oi high sta-
ory tion, such as Agrippa, Pollio, and others. ’

gd, That an injunction to iay aside the care or study of
gain (studium lucri) is very inappropriate to the liberal and
generous character assigned to the poet. But here again it
is said, that it is absurd to take literally what is obviously
written in jest. 1f a man, the most indifferent to gain, had,
sor instance, informed us that he thought he could sellan

olive
Now Thracian breezes, comrades os the spring,
Temper the ocean and impel the saiis 3
Frost crisps not now the fields, nor rage the iloods,
Swoilen with winter snows.
