472 Tae Epodes of Horace.

By this vain purple’s childish omament'-
· By Jove’s sure wrath—why are thy looks as deadly
As the stepmother's on the babe she loathes,
Or wounded wild beast's, glaring on the hunter?''
As me boy pleaded thus, with tremulous lip,
From him lierce hands rent childbood’s robe and bulla,
And naked stood that form which might have moved,
With its young innocence, a Thracian’s pity.

Canidia, all her tangled tresses crisped
By the contracted folds ot' angry vipers,

Spake, and bade mandrakeS,torn lrom dead men's graves,†
Bade dismal branches os sunereal cypress,

And eggs and plumes os the night screechowl smeared
With the toad’s loathsome and malignant venom,

Herbs which Iolcos and Hiberia sendi
From soils whose richest harvestcrops are poison,

And bones, irorn jaw os iamished wildbitch snatched,§-
Bade them all simmer in the Colchian oaldron.l

Meanwhile, bare-legged, seli Sagana bedews

The whole abode with helldrops from Avemuail
Her locks ercet as some sea-urchin barbed,

Or wild boar bristling as he runs. Then Veia,

θ “Per hoc inane purpurae decus precor.” This is the “toga prae·
terta’' which was worn by iree Roman children, together with the
‘⁴ bulla,”a small round plate oi gold suspended from the neck Both
were relinquished on the adoptiones the “toga virilis,” about the age
oi filieen.

i '⁸ Sepulcris caprificos erutas‚” the wild fig rooted up from graves

i Hiberia here doce not, as elsewhere, mean Spain, but a region, now
part ol Georgia, east ol Colchis. Iolcos was aseaport oi Thessaly.

§ Why bones snatched from the jaws oi a huugry bitch should have
the virtue that lits mem ior ingredients in the witchoe’ oeldron is not
clearly explained by the commentatore It is not only the angry slaver
os the laurishing bitch robbed oi her lood that gives me bone its nemo·
