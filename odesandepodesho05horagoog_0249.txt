238 . Τ lte Odcs os Horace..

Man vies with man—’tis so ordained3 this, wider sets his
vines*
That‚ notter-born, the Campus'r seeks, competitor for power
With one who boasts os purer lise,
And one os clients more :

Necessity with equal law assorts the varying lots 3
Th0ugh this may bear the losty name and that may bear the
’ low,
Each in her ample urn she shakes,
And casts the die sor alli

To him above whose guilty neck hangs down the naked
sword‚
Sicilian arts elaborate not the sweets that flavor sood,
Nor song of bird nor chord of lute
Charms back the truant sleep.§

Yet sleep is rneek, nor scoms the cots that shelter rural toil,
Nor banks that find their pall os state in shadowy summer
boughs, ¹
Nor vales in Tempe never vexed
Save by the Zephyr’s wing.

t “Est ut viro virlatius ordinet
Arbusta sulcis’'

“Est ut,” “it is the case, it is ordained that men should varyin wealth
and condition.”-Yorror. “Latius ordinet arbusta sulcis ’'-via, one
man may compete with another man in extent oi possessionsr literally
that he may marshal trees-chiefly, but not exclusively, vines-in par·
allel lines, or in the shape ol the quincunx, toa greater extent than
another.

l ‘⁸ Descendat in Campum.” It was on the Campus Martius that the
Comitia Centuriata, at which the election os magistrates took place, were
held The Campus was on low ground; but Yonge observes that

“descendat '⁸ is the exact word to express a contest, to descend into the
arena. ’
