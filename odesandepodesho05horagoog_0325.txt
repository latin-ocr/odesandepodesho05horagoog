314 Τ lae Odes of Horace.

Ο my Maecenas! ger'n
Of Roman lrnighthood‚* ever have Ι feared

To list a erest above the crowd conspicuous-
Rightly3 the more man shall deny himself,
The more shall gods bestow.
I do not side wilh werith, but, lightly armed,

Bound 0’er the lines, deserting to Contentment;
Owner more grand in means the rich despise‚
Than were I said to hide, ,

In mine own granaries, all Apulia yields

Her toiling sons, want-pinched amidst heaped plenty 2-
A brooklet pure, some roods of woodland cool, ¹
F aith in erops, sure is small-
Are a lot happier‚ though he knows it not,

Than his who glitters in the spoils of Afric.
Though not for me toil the Calabrian beeS,
Nor wines in Fornrian jars
Languish their lire in length of years away,

Nor fleeey wools gain weight in Gallie pastores,
Yet Penury keeps aloof ς nor, lacked I more,
More wouldst thou me deny:
Widening my means by narrowing my desires,

Ι shall have ampler· margin for true riehes
Than if lo Lydia adding Phrygian realms.
W ho covets much, much wants; Δ
God gives most kindly, giving just enough.

* ‘¹ Maecenas, equiturn decus” By this significant reference to
Maecenas as the ornament of knighthood Horace associates Maecenas
with himself in the philosophy of contentment-Maecenas having always
remained in the equestrian order, to which he was born, declining pro·
motion to the senatorial.
