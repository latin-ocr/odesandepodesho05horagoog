another, it seems strange that a poet of character so grateful
as Horace’s should have refrained from all mention of one to

whom he was under no mean obligations for the popularity
bis verses had acquired, and with whom he must bave been
necessarily brought into frequent and familiar intercourse.
It may, however, be said, as sufficient reason for such silence
in either case, that a Roman of Horace's day would not have
held the art of a musical composer in high account.

The writers who have sought to elucidate the obscure
subJ'ect of ancient music consider it probable that nothing
like the modern system of musical rhythm existed among
the ancients, and that, since there is no mention of noranta
distinct from the metre of the song, the time was marked
by that metre where vocal music was united with instru-
mental (Bumey's “ History of Music ;’' Hawkips's “ Hist. of
Music ;'' Smith's Dict.‚ art. ‘¹ Musica ’'). By this the reader
can judge for himself whether Horace’s task in timing the
music to his own rhythms would not have been compara-
tively easy; and whether, if it were thus easy, it would bave

been considered worthy of commemoration by his con· ·

temporaries, or been preserved in such brief records of his
life as were consulted by Suetonius, or known to the
’ scholiasts.
At all events, Horace appears, on the occasion of the
Secular Hymn, to have superintended the rehearsal of the
recitative
O Phoebus, and O forestoueen Diana,
Ye the twin lustrous ornament of heaven,
Though ever holy, in this time most hallowed,
Be most benign to prayerl

For duly now, as Sibyl verse enjoins us,
Pure youthS, with chosen virgins linked in chorus

To Powers divine o'er the Seven Hills presiding,
Uplist the solemn hymn.
