Thee, arch-surreyor of the earth and ocean
And the innumerous sands, Archytas, thee,
Pent in a creeklet margined by Matinus,
. The scanty boon of trivial dust keeps close.

. ’ What boots it now into the halls of Heaven
To have presumed‚ and drawn empyreal air,
Ranged through the spheres and with thy mind of mortal
Swept through creation to arrive at death?

The sire of Pelops with the gods did banquet,

And yet he died 3—remote into thin air
Vanished, if lingering long, at last Tithonus3

Minos shared Jove's high secrets,-yet he died.

The son of PanthouS, though he called to witness*
'His ancient buckler and the times of Troy,

That to grim death he gave but skin and sinen,
Tartarus regains,-and, this time, holds him fast ς

Yet he of Truth and Nature, in thy judgment,
1 Was an authority os no mean rank.
But one Night waits for ali, and one sure pathway

Troddcn by all, and only trodden once.

Some do⁴ the Furies to grim Mars exhibit
On the red stage in which disports his eye;

The greedy ocean snaliows up the sailors; 1
Old nod young huddled snell the funeral throng3
