446 Τ lte ddes of Horace.

virtues from which have grown the Roman name,
Italia's might, lame, and majestic sway‚
To the Sun's Orient rise, '
From his calm bed in our Hesperian scas

Caesar our guardian, neither civil tage*
Nor telon violence scares us from repose,
Nor irc which sharpens swords,
And makes the wars oi nations and their woes

Neither the drinkers of deep Danube break
The Julian Laws, nor Scyths, nor Seres frerce,
Nor Persia’s faithless sons,
Nor wild men cradled on the banlrs oi Don.

So, with each sacred, with each common day
(Prayer, as is due, first rendered to the gods),

’Mid blithesome Liber's boons,
Gathering our women and our children round,

’ Let us, as did our fathers in old time,
Honor with hymns and Lydian fise brave chiefs:
Sing Troy; Anchises sing3
Sing oi the racc from gentle Venus sprung.

‘⁴ Non furor
C ivilis aut vis exiget otium,
Non ira, quae procudit enses,
Et miseras inimicat urbes”
Three causes oi tear are removed; “Furor civilis,” “civil war? “vis‘'
‘⁴ personat violence ;” “ira” ¹⁴ foreign Μεθ’
