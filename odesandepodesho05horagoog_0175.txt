164 The Odes ofHoraae.

Now, now, thou strik'st the ear with murmurous threat
From choral horus-now the loud clarions blar'e 3
Lightnlngs from armor llashed, ’
Daunt charging war-steeds* and the looks oi ment ,

Now, now, I seem to hear the mighty chielS,
Solled with the dust which ornaments the brave,

And see all earth subdued,
Save the intrepld soul ol Cato. Foiled

Ol her revenge, Juno, with all the gods,
Quitting the Afric they had loved in vain,
Back to Jugurtha’s shade
Brought funeral victims in his conqueror’s sona

What field, made fertile by the Roman’s gore, ·
Attests not impious wars by ghastly mounds,
And by the erash‚ borne lar
To Median ears, ol falling Italy?

· What gutt, what stream, has boomed not with the wail
Of dismal battle-stormsl What sea has hues

From Daunian earnage pure,
What land has lacked the tribute of our blood?

Hush, wayward Mtise, nor, playlul strains laid by,
Sttive to recast the Cean’s† dirgelike hymn 3
in Dionaean gret,
With me, seek measures tuned to lighter quill.

⁸ “Fugam terret equo& “fugaces’' here does not mean steeds

was ol a severe and melancholy east-llllctttttttt¹
