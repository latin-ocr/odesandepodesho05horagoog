’ 11⁶ The oros fflorace.

Sunless side oi the world, which the grim air oppresses, .
Mistclad aud icc-bound3 ·

Place me lone where the earth is denied to nran’s dwelling,

All so near to its breast glows the car oi the daygod3
And 1 still should love Lalage—her the sweetsmiiing,
Her the sivest-talking*

ι “Dulce ridentem hlassentmabm
Dulce loquentem.”

111 might have allowed myseli to expand the literni words oi the on'gi·
nal into what seems to me the sense implied by the poet, 1 should have
proposed to musione the lines thus :-

“1 still should love luinge-ree ier, sweet smilingl
Hm her, sweet rokingi'

For 1 take it that Horace does not merely mean that he would still
love Lalage “sweetly smiling¹' sud “sweetly talking ”-an assume
which seems in itseli ro belong to a school oi poetry rulgsrly celled
samby-pamby-but rather that, however solitsry, still, and lileless be
the place to which he might be transported,he would still be so true to
her irruge‚thst in the solitode he would see her sweetiy smiling,and
amidst the silence hear her sweerly talking. So eonstmoe in shak-
spesre, says:
'⁸ Griel fille the rouen up oi roy sheenl child.
