ODE XV.

ΤΟ AUGUSTUS ott m amomon 01· met

This ode is the appropriate epilogue to· the Fomth Book,
os which the poems that celebrate the Roman victorico under
Drusus and Tiberius constitute the noblest portion Ii it be
true that the boolr was published on account os these odes,
and at the desire oi augustus, Horace would naharally con-
clude by a special reference to the beneficia] inertes oi the
wars undertaken by Augustus, and from the final completion
ol' which in Gaul, Germany, and Spain, he had just returned
to Rome. Horace here begins by saying, that when he

wished

of wars and vanquished cities when 1 longed
To sing, Apollo checked me with his lyre,

Lest l launched sails so slight
Into so vast a deep. Caesar, thy reign

Has given back golden harvests to our fields ς
Our standards, torn from Parthia's haughty walls,
Restored to Roman Jove ;
Closed gates ol Janus, vacant os a war;

To righteous order rampant license curbed,
lhrust srom the state the vices* which defiled,
And, in their moad, recalled
The ancient virtues to their satherland,†-
