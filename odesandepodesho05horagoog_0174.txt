Canu. 1.

Motum ex Metello consule civicum,
Bellique causas et vitia et modos,
Ludumque Fortunae, gravesque
Principum amicitias, et arma

Nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus,
Periculosae plenum opus alea,
Tractas et incedis per ignes
Suppositos cineri doloso.

Paullum severae Musa tragoediae
Desit theatris ε mox ubi publicas
Res ordinaris, grande munus

Cecropio repetes cothurno,

Insigne maestis praesidium reis
Et consulenti, Pollio, curiae,
Cui laurus aeternos honores
Delmatico peperit triumpho.
