T he Odcs of Horace.

ODE V.
ro evanue.

Ican not presume to attempt any thymeless version oi '
this ode in juxtaposition with Milton’s famous translation,
which 1 therefore annea. “Any resemblance between the

melre
What slender youth, bedewed with liquid odora*
Courts thee on roses in some'pleasant cave,†
Pyrrha? for whom bind’st thou
In wreaths thy golden hair,

Plain in thy neatness? Ο, how oft shall he
On saith and changed gods comptonam seas
Rough with black winds, and storms
Unwonted shall admirel

Who now enjoys thee credulous, all gold,
Who always vacant, always amiable
Hopes thee, of flattering gales
Unmindful. Hapless they

T' whom thou untried seem'st sair l Me, in my vowed
Pictore, the sacred wall declares t’ have hung
My dank and dropping weeds
To the stern god of seat

* The reader will observo that the first lineis the only one in the
translation which ends with a dissyllable. Whether Milton makes this
variation ol the rhythm he selecta through oversight or intention, the read·
ercan conjecture sor himselt Probably Milton regarded the two first
lines os each strophe simply as heroic blank verse, in which the termina·
tion by a monosyllable or dissyllable is optional.

τ ‘⁶ Grato, Pyrrha, sub antro.'' ¹¹ Some pleasant cave ’² appears scarce-
ly to give the sense ot the original. “Antrum ’' means the grotta attached
to the housesol the luxurious, and in which was placed astatue oi Venus.
Grottoes are still in use among the richer Italians, and it is not sorae cave
to which Horace alludes, but with a certain tenderness os reproach to the
grotta in which Pyrrha had been a'ccustomed to receive him.

1¹⁸Potenti-maris deo” Milton translates “the stern god ot sea,”
