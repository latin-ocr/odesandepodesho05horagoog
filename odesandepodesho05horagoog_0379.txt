368 · Τ he Odes of Horace.

was intrusted to Ateius Capito, a celebrated jurist and anti-
quary, and Horace was requested to compose the principal
hymn on the occasion. The games were held in the sum- Ι
mer of the year ac. η. They were repeated four times
during the Empire, but not at the periods enjoined by
the Quindecimviri under Augustus-viz, in cycles of
110 years. The second took place, run. 47, in the reign
of Claudius; the third, no. 88, in the reign of Domitian;
and the fourth in the reign of Philippus, sn. 248. For
further particulars of the ceremony the general reader is re
ferred to Smith's Dict, art “Ludi Saeculares’'; and for the
mystical belief that the world was moving 'in a cycle, the
completion of which constituted the Magnus Annus, when
all the heavenly bodies returned to their original relative
places, see Orelli and Macleane’s introduction to the Secular

the great Platonic year of the universe was not defined, but

declared from time to time by prodigies from heaven, so
this belief may account for the irregular periods in which
the Secular Festival was held during the Empire.

When Horace boasts (Lib. 111. Carm. xxx.) that he shall
be spoken of as the first who adapted AEolian song to
Italian mensures, he must mean something more than the

mere introduction of Greek lyrical metres into the Italian Δ

language. In this task Catullus had preceded him. He
nowhere mentions Catullus; and though that omission has
been ascribed to jealousy, there is no evidence of so envious
adefect in Horace’s general character. He bestows lavish
praise on the eminent poets of his own time; and ajealous

poet is more apt to be jealous of living contemporaries than “

of dehinct predecessors. Nor is it to be sorgotten that, if

Horace confines his boast to the mere introduction of Les· ·

bian metres, the Sapphics of Catullus must have been suffi-
ciently fresh in popular recollection to afford his enemies
one of those opportunities for confuting a boast and turning
it into ridicule which are not voluntarily courted by a man
