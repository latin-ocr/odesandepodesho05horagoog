Book [IL-ode VI. 275

addressed, in the original, lines from 21 to 32, not to freed·
women and singing-girls, but to the well-bom maidens and
brides ol Rome. That the poem was written about the same
time as the others is a reasonable conjecture, and probably
with the same intention os assisting the relorms of Augustus,
among which Horace subsequently celebrates the stricter
laws regulating and aflecting marriage. But I do not think
the poem was or could be one of those speci· Ily addressed
to the young3 and, independently ol the lines have referred
to, the concluding stema, in fierce condemnation of them-
selves and their immediate parents, would be very unlike the

skilllul way in which Horace “admissus circum praeco'rdia
ludit.’.'

Saxa, legate to Μ. Antony. Four years later, when Pacorus was dead,
the Parthians defeated Antony commanding in person. lt is not known
who is meant by Monaeses. Plutarcb'rnentions a Parthian ol that name
who ded to Antony‚ but it nowhere appears that he bore arms against
the Romans Orelli and Macleane favor the conjecture that by Mo·
naeses is meant Surenas, who defeated Crassus, amc 701-supposing
Surenas to be merely an Oriental title ol dignity, and Monaeses to have
been the proper name ol Crassus’s conqueror.
