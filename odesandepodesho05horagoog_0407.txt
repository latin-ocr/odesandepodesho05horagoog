396 T he Odes of Horace.

Ol battle than ol sood, Ι
Drives him on dragous that resist his beak3

Or as in gladsome pastures the wild roe,
About to die by sangs undeshed before,
Sees the fierce lion-whelp,
Fresh trom the udders ol the tawny darn ;-

So the Vindelici young Drusus saw
Leading war home to their own Raetian Alps ,⁸
Whence srorn all time they learned
To arm their hands with Amazonian axel

I pause not now to ask 3 nor is the lore
Of all things lore allowed ς enough that hosts,
Victorinus long and l'ar, '
Vanquished in turn by a young arm and brain,

Felt what the mind and what the heart achieve,
When reared and sostered amidst blest abodes‚
And with parental love
A Caesar’s soul inspires a Nero's sons.

Brave and good natures generate natures brave.
In steer and steed ancestral virtue shows.
Bold eagles never yet,
Instead os eaglets, begot timorous doves.

⁸ “Videre Raetis bella sub Alpibus” Macleane agrees with Orelli
in adopting Bentley's emendation—“Ratis'’ instead os “Rae”-See
Orelli'e excursus to this ode, and Macleane's comprehensive note. Rit-
⁰ter and Munro have ⁴⁴ Raeti.'’
l “Quibus
Mos unde deductus per omne
Tempus Amazonia securi
Dextrae obarmet, quaerere distuli ε
Nec scire tas eet omnia.”

These lines are so little in poetic keeping with the noble eamestness ol ·
