ODE XXIV.

To utnon, Oli THE neam OF Qurwcnuus VARUS·¹

Qiincrilius died nuc. 730. Little is known of him be

Ι yond the mention with which heis immortalized by Horace.
In the Ars Poetica he is spoken of as dead, and as having
been a irank and judiciously severe critic, who, iiyou trusted
your

What shame or what restraint unto the yearning

For one so lovedi Music attuned to sorrow
Lead* thou, Melpomene, to whom the Father

Gave liquid voice and lyre.

So, the etemal slumber clasps Quinctilius,
Whose equal when shall shameiaced sense oi Honor,

Incorrupt raith, oi Justice the twin sister,
Or Truth unveiled, lind?

By many a good man wept‚ he died 3—no moumer

Wept with tears sadder than thine own, Ο Virgill

Pious, alas, in vainl thou redemandest
Quinctilius irom the gods5

Not on such ternis they lent him l-Were thy harpstrings
Blander than those by which the Thracian Orpheus
Charmed listening iorests, never flows the lifeblood

Back to the phantom form

Which Hermes, not reopening Fate's closed portal

Athaman prayer, amid the darlr flock shepherds

With ghastly rod. Hard! yet still Patience lightens
That which admits no cure.
