Upon hill-peaks the holmoaks that rock to his blast!
On the blackness of night let no friendly star glimmer
Save the balesul Orion, whose setting is storm3
Nor the deep know a billow more calm tham the breakers
Which o’erwhelmed the victorious armada os Greece,
When, from Ilion consumed, to the vessel of Ajax
Pallas· turned the wrath due to her temple prosaued!
Ha, what sweatdrops will run from the brows os thy sailors,
And how palely thy puddle-blood 'ooze from thy cheeks;
As thou call’st out sor aid—with that shriek which shames
’ manhood†—
On the Jove who disdains such a caitiff to hear;
When thy keel strains and cracks in the deep gulf Ionic,
Howling back the grim how] of the stormy south-blase
But 01 is in some desolate creek thou shalt hrruish
To the maw of the sea-gulls a' banquet superb,
To the Tempests alamb and lewd goat shall be offered
As a tn'bute of thanks sor deliveranee from thee.
