Thesauris Arabum et divitis hdie,
Camentis licet occupes
Tyrrhenum omne tuis et mare Apulicum‚*

Fruges et Cererem lerunt,

Nec cultura placet longior annua3
Defunctumque laboribus

AEquali recreat sorte vicarius.

the poet refers in the line that follows.

here imputed‚ correctly or not, to the Getae.
