434 , The Odes effHorace.

ODE XIII.

ro arca, Α ranan scauri.

No subjectos inquiry can be less interesting toa criticos
good sense than that on which so many learned disputants
have wasted theIr time—viz, who among the ladies cele·
brated by Horace were real persons or imaginary3 and who
are to be admitted into or rejected from the genuine cata·
logue of his loves? We have absolutely no data to go
upon. There is no reason, except that he chooses to apply
the same name to both, to suppose that the Lyce over whose
ruined charms he now exults was the Lyce os whose cruelty
he complains, Lib. III. Od. x.; nay, I believe that most
recent scholars are pretty well agreed that the ode last
mentioned was an artistic exercise, imitated from the Greek

serenades.

They have heard my praycrs, Lyce, the gods;
The gods have heard, Lyce, thou’rt old,
Yet still, setting up sor a beauty,
Thou wouldst tipple and frisk with the young 3

Courting, maudlin, with tremulous chant,
Laggard Cupid: he’s absent on guard
O'er the bloom on the cheelrs oi young Chia,
Whose lute is more sweet than thy song*

For he roosts not on oaks without sap;
Hollow teeth and dry wrinkles he flies,
He is chilled by the snow ot' gray tresses,
And thus has retreated from thee.

¹* There is an opposition between Lyce’s tremulous quaver, ‘¹ cantu
tremulo,¹' aud Chia’s musical skill, ‘⁴ doctae psallere,” whichean only, per·
haps, be made clear by some slight paraphrase, as is attempted in the last
line oi the stante, in translation.
