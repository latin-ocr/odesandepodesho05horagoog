420 Tlu Odes of Horace.

ODE IX.
ro coruus.

As the preceding poem was addressed to a man who re-
tained unblemisbed a popular reputation to the last, and
whose death was considered a public calamity, so this poem,

which equally treats οἰ the immortality it is the gill oi poets
to bestow, is addressed to one who, if we are to take sor

granted such historical records ol' him es are lest, was the
subjectos merited obloquy in his later years, and died by

, poison which he administered to himself, to the great joy of
. his countrymen. And it was ior the vices most opposite to

the specialwirtues Horace here ascribes to Lollius—viz, ior
rapacity and corruption-rthat his character, rightly or wrong-
ly, has been most delamed. His vindication has been, bow-
. ever,very ably attempted by 'late (“ Vindiciae Lollianoe ”),and
the evidence against him is generally considered lo rest
upon prejudiced and questionable authority.-See Fstrd,

Hor.

Lest, perchance, thou believe that the words which to music,
Ι, whose birth was where Aufidus rushes iar-sounding,
Linlred by arts not before me divulged,
Are but sounds that are sated to die 3

Remember, that though the first throne be great Homeffs,
There are muses not tuneless, Pindaric and Caean ;
With Alcaeus, yet threateuing and fierc'e3
With Stesichorus, stately and grave.

Time destroys not what once sported loose in Anacreon 3
To this day breathes the love, to this 'day glows the ardor,
Which the girl of AEolia consigned
To the strings oi her passionate lyre.
