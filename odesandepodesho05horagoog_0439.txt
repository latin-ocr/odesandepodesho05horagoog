428 The Odes of Horace.

As it whirls the smoke cresting the point ol its summit
Round and around ic*

But that now thou mayst know to what mirth 1 invite thee,
’Tis inhonoros Ides, not ungratet'ul to Phyllis,

’Tis the day that halves April, swcct month in which Venus
Rosc out ol ocean ς

Day, indeed, that by me should bc solemnized duly-

Scarce mine own natal day 1 hold equally sacred,

Since it is by its light, year on year, my Maecenas
Sums up lile's riches.

Corne, that Telephus whom thou art secking (poor Phyllis!

He’s a youth above thee) is now chained to another.

She is wanton and rich, and she holds him in bondage,
Pleased with his letters.

Phaethon, burnt in his chariot, deters from ambition,
Wingdd Pegasus spurning Bellerophon earth-born
May admonish thee also by this solemn lesson,

“ Seek but what suits thee ;'’

Dccming Hope, when it flies out ol reach, is unlawsul,

Ο set not thy heart where the lots arc uncqual.

Come, with me be contented, ot' all loves my latest,
Love with'thee endeth.

Alter thee never more woman’s lacc' shall inflame me3
Ο, be checred, then, and corne 5 let mc teach thee such
measures
As thc voice which I love into sweetness shall render;
Song lessens sorrow.

ἱ “Sordidum flamma trepidant rotantes
Vertice lumnm.”

“‘Vertice' is the top ot' the fleme, which {licitere as it whirls the dart
smoke on its erest-a spiral flame,cu1minating in a column ol smolte.
It seems as il Horace were waiting with alite buming before him, and
caught the idea as he wrote.”-Mnct.snnr.
