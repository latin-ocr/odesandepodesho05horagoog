94 The Odcs of Horace.

“Or the chariotehasedearlessly follow: , ,
Merion, too, thou shalt know‚-but look yonder,
Through the battle comes raging to find thee

Tydides, more dread than his sire!

“ Ah 1 from him, as adan in the valley

Sees the wolf and forgetteth its pastum,

All unnerved and deeppantidg thou fliest 3
Not such was the pledge to thy lovel

“Though the wrath ἰῃ the fleet os Achilles
Bring a respite to Troy and Troy's mothem
Ilion's domes, after winters predestined,

shall sink in the flames of the Greek Γ·
