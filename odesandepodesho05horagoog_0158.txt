told. Demaratus, one of the Bacchiadae of Corinth, flying
from his native city'when Cypselus destroyed the' power of
that aristocratic order, settled at Tarquinii, in Etruria, 3ηά
married an Etruscan wife. His son Lucumo succeeded to
his wealth, and married Tanaquil, of one of the noblest
families in Tarquinii, but being, as a stranger, excluded from
state offices, Lucumo, urged by his wife, resolved to remove
to Rome. Just as he and his procession reached the Janic-
ulum, within sight of Rome, an eagle seized his cap, soared
with it to a great hei'ght-“ cum magno clangore '’-and then

replaced iton his head. Tanaquil predicted to him the Ι

highest honors from this omen, and Lucumo, who assumed
the name of Tarquinius Priscus, ultimately obtained the

' Roman throne. Macleane, in referring to the legend, and

to the reference to Phraates, thinks it not probable that Hor-
ace meant to allude to both these historical facts together,
and is therefore inclined to suppose that he intended neither
one nor the other. His objection does not impress me.
· Nothing is more probable thau that Horace should exem-
plify the sudden act of fortune in the Parthian revolution
and render his allusion more lively bya metaphor horrowed

’ ftom a familiar¹ Roman myth.

Plerumque, per purum tonantes
Egit equos volucremque currum,
