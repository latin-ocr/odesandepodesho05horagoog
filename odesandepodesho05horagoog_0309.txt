298 Τ he odes of Horace.

The tortured lips ol Tityos and Ixion

Reluctant smiled3 awhile their um stood thirsting

As paused the Danaids, to the charmer's music
Dreamily listening.

Let Lyde hear the guilt ol those stern virgins,
Hear, too, their well-known penance ; doomed forever
To toil at filling up a sieve-like vessel ;

Tell her how surely

stow lates await such crimes,-though under Orcus ς

Impious—sor can impiety be greater?

Impious in giving to the sword their bridegrooms,
Ruthlessly murdered.*

Amidst the many, One alone was worthy
Τὴε nuptial torch ;-a maid, through all the ages,
By glorious salsehood to her perjured father,

N obly immortal.

“Rise,‘’ to her youthsul bridegroom, thus she whispered ;
“ Rise, lest there come, and whence thou dost suspect not,
Into thy lids the everlasting slumberl

Baffle my fathery

“ Elude my blood-stained sisters—lionesses;

Each-woe is me l-her separate victim rending:

Of soster mould, I can nor strike nor pen thee
Here, in these shamblesl

’ * The old mythologists differ among themselves as to the iable ο1
Danaus and the tate ol his daughters Horace here adopts the com·
mon story that Danaus, having reason to think that the fifty sons ol his

brother AEgyptus were plotting against him, lled with his lilly daughters
from Libya (the domain assigned him by his father Belus, AEgyptus

having Arabia), and ultimately became King ol Argos His nephews
carne to his new realm and ,demanded his daughters in marriage.
