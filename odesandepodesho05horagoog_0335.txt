Coeval with me, born when Manlius was consul, ·
Whatsoe’er the effects ol thy lile, while in action-
Spleen or mirth, angry brawl or wild love,
Or,O gentle cask,* ready slumber—

The grapes thou hast kept since in Massicus gatlrered,

Asking wines by age mellowed 1 He will not neglect thee,
All imbued though he be with Socratical maxims.

Makest gentle the harsh, and confiding the cautious.

pretatiom ‘¹ gentle, kindly,”-ohserving ‘⁴ it would be ‘impia' ii produc-
5¹¹8 ‘querelas rixas‚'” etc 1 have translated ‘⁴ testa '' cask, as a word
familiar to the English reader, but it here properly means the ampliora,
a vessel into which the wine was, as we should say, bottled.
