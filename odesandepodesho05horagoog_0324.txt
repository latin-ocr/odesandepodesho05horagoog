Chen. XVI.

Inclusam Danaen turris aenea

Robustaeque lores,* et vigilum eanum

Tristes excubiae munierant satis
Nocturnis ab adulteris,

Si non Acrisium virginis abdicet

Custodem pavidum, Juppitcr et Venus

Risissent: sore enim tutum iter et patens
Converso in pretium deo.

Aurum per medios ire satellites,

Et perrumpere amat saxa potentius

Ictu fulmineo: concidit auguris
Argiviss domus ob lucrum

Ι Demersa exitio; diffidit urbium
Portas vir Macedo,§ et subruit aemulos
Reges muneribus ; munera navium

Saevos illaqueant ducesll

Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam
Majorumque sames. Jure perhorrui
