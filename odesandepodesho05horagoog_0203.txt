192 The Odes os Horace.

ODE IX.

ro e. vannius nurus
(In Coruolation.)

This Valgius, os consular rank', appears to have been
much esteemed in his time as a poet He wrote elegies ancl ’
epigrams, and' had even a high claim to the pretensions ol
an epic poet, according to the author of the “Panegyric
on Messala ”-

“Est tibi, qui posset magnis se accingere rebus,
Valgius, aetemo propior non alter Homero.”

Horace might therefore well call upon him to lay aside his
elegiae complaints and sing the triumphs ol Augustus. lle

'Tis not always the fields are made rough by the rains,

’Tis not always the Caspian is harried by storrn 3
Neither is it each mouth in the year
That the ice stands inert on the shores oi Armenia;

Nor on losry Garganus the lond-greaning oaks
Wrestle, rocked to and fro with the blasts of the north,
Nor the ash-trees droop widowed ol leaves.
Ο my friend, O my Valgius, shall grief last sorever?

Vct thy heart in its yeaming forever pursues
The loved and lost Mystes ; the star of the cve,
And the sunrise which chases the star,
F ind thy love still lamenting the loss ol thy Mystes

But the old man, who three generations lived through,
Did not lor Antilochus mourn all his years:

· Nor sor Troilus, nipped in his bloom,

Flowed sorever the tears os his pare‘uts and sistens.
