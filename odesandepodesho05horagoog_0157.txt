146 Τ lte Odes of Horace.

ODE XXXIV.

To BIMSELF.

In this poem Horace appears to recant the Epicurean Ι
doctrine, which referred to secondary causes, and not to the
providentia] ageucy of Divine power, the government of the
universe, and which he professed, Sat. I. v. 101, and Epp,
1. iv. 16. But, in fact, he candidly aclrnowledges his own
inconsistency in all such matters, and is Stoic or Epicurean
by lits and starts. In this ode he evidently connects the
phenomenon of thunder in a serene sky with 'the sudden rev-
olutions of fortune. The concluding verses are generally
held to refer to the Parthian revolution, in which power was

transferred uow from Phraates to Tiridates, and again from
Tiridates back to Phraates. In the last stanza-

Ι ‘⁴ Hinc apicem rapax
Fortuna curu stridore acuto
Sustulit, hic posuisse gaudet ”-

it was suggested in the “Cambridge Philological Museum,”
May, 1832, that Horace had in his mind the legendos
the eagle taking offbthe cap of Tarquinius. For the conve·

niepce of the general reader the story may be briefly thus
told.

Worshipper rare and niggard of the gods,
While led astray, in the Fool’s wisdom versed,
- Now back I shift the sail,

Forced in the courses left behind to steer:

For not, as wont, disparting serried cloud
With fiery flash, but through pure azure, drove .
Of late Diespiter
His thundering coursers and his wingbd car 3
