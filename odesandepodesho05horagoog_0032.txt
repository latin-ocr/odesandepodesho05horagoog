Introduclzbn. xxi

Ι fuluess to nature so limited to a circumscribed range of
mind, that, even in England, neither the mirthful nor the

' melancholy man, unless he be a poet or a student, recog-

nizes ineither poem his own favorite tastes and pleasures.
But where Horace describes men’s pleasures, every man
finds something of himself 3 the familiar kindliness of his
langnage impresses its poetry upon those who have no pre-
tension to be poets. Had Horace written with equal length
and with equal care an ‘¹ Allegro” and a “Penseroso‚” not
only the poet and the student, not only the man of senti-
ment and reflection, but all varieties in our common family
-the young lover, the ambitious schemer, the man of pleas-
ure, the country yeoman, the city clerk, even the rural la·
borer—would have found lines in which he saw himself as in
amirror.

Thus, then, Horace's exquisite felicity of wording is for ι
the most part free from any sustained attempt at a language
essentially distinct from that of conversation 3 and for that
very reason its beauties of poetical expression both please
and strike the more, because they have more the air of those
spontaneous flashes of genius which delight us in a great
orator orabrilliant talker. '

Ican not pass by without comment a characteristic of
Horace's “form ” in lyrical poetry‚ which is too striking to
escape the notice of any ordinary critic; but no critic has at-
tempted satisfactorily to define the principles of art to which
its peculiar fascination may be traced. Itis in the choice
of epithets derived from proper names, or rather the names
of places, by which “generals '¹ are individualized into “ par-
ticulars.’' The sea is not the sea in general—it is the Ha·
drian, or the Myrtoan, or the Caspian sea3 the ship is not
a ship in general—it is the Cyprian or the Bithynian ship ς
the oaks, which are not always shaken by the blast, are not
the oaks in general—they are the oaks upon Garganus ; the
ilex, which thrives by being pruned, is not an ilex in general
