240 T lte Odcs os Horace.

To him who curbs desire within the bounds of “The
Enough,”
The wildest blasts that heave the sea awake no sear of wreck 3
He quails not though Arcturus set,
Or Haedus rise, in stonu3

Though reel the vines beneath the hail, though crops belie
the hope, .
Though trees despoiled of fruit accuse now spring's corrod-

ing showers,
Now summer’s scorch and frery stars,
Now winter's crowning wrongs.

Lo, where the mighty moles extend new lands into the deep,
The scale'd races feel their sea shrink round the invading
iles ··
Aspman‘y a builder's burly gang
Heaves the huge rubble down,*,

Obedient to a lord who scorns so small'a bound as earth3
Yet conscience, whispering fears and threats, ascends with
him the tower,
Black Care sits by him in the bark,
' Behind him, on the steed.†

Since Phrygian marbless nought avails to southe a mind
diseased,

And nought the pomp of purple robes albeit outshining stare,
And nought the Achaemenian balrn,
Nought the Falemian vine ;

’ “Huc frequens
Caementa demittit redemptor
Cum famulis!

“Caernenta,” the rough mixture os large and small stones, mortar, eto,

(rubbie), which served ior foundations. “Redemptor,’' literally the
“ contractor” or “architem‘'
