TO hlAECENAS.

This ode is addressed to Maecenas in illness, but the date ,
ol the illness is necessarily uncertain in the lise ol avale·
tudinarian like Maecenas. Though, as Mac'leane observes,
the last two lines of this ode, showing that Horace had
· not yet paid the sacrifice he had vowed to Faunus sor his
preservation from death, makes it, most probable that it was
written not long aster C. 13 ol this book, the composition ol
which has been assigned, with some hesitation, to auc. 728.
Maecenas was subject to what appears to have been a low
nervous sever, attended with loss of sleep. According to the
verses attributed to him, and censured with a stoic's lolty
disdain by Seneca (Epp. ror), Maecenas had a passionate
and clinging desire for lile, very uncommon in a Roman,
deeming that, under any suffering or infirmity, lile was still

dear—
“Vita

Why destroyest thou me with the groan os thy sufferings?
Neither 1 nor the gods will let thee die before me,
Ο Maecenas, the glory and grace
And the column itself, of my lise.

Ah! is some fatal sorec, prematurely bereaving,
Wrenched from me the one half of my soul, cpuldthe other
Linger on, with its dearer part lost,
And the fragment ol what was a whole?

No! in thy lise is mine; both, the same day shall shatter.

I have made no false vow, where thou lead’st me I follow ,·
Fellow-travellers, the same solemn rond
Ι We will take, we will take, side by side.
