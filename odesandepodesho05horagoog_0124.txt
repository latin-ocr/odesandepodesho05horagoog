Dianam tenerae dicite virgines,
Intonsum‚ pueri, dicite Cynthium ς
Latonamque supremo
Dilectam penitus Jovi.

Vos laetam fluviis et nemorum corna,
Quaecuuque aut gelido prominet Algido,
Nigris aut Erymanthi
Silvis, aut viridis Cragi ,d

Vos Tempe totidem tollite laudibus,

Natalemque, mares, Delon Apollinis,
Insignemque pharetra

Fratemaque humerum lyra.†

Hic bellurn lacrimosum, iric miseram samem
Pestemque a populo, et principe Caesare, in
Persas atque Britannos
Vestra motus aget prece.
