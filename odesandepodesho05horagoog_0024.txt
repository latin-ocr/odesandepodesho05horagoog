ire to an elevated rank in poetry. Satire, indeed, is the an·
tipodes oi poetry in its essence and its mission. Satire al· ‘
ways tends to dwarf, and it can not sail to caricature 3 but '

poetry does nothing ii it does not tend to enlarge and ex-
alt, and is it does not seek rather to beautiiy than deionn.
And though such didactic and moralizing vein as belongs to
the Epistles oi Horace bein itseli much higher than satire,
and in him has graces oi style that, with his usual consum·
mate taste, he rejects lor satire, wls'ch he regards but as a

' ⁸ rhythmical prose, still, the higher atmosphere in which the

genius ol lyrical song buoys and disports itseli is not within
the scope oi that didactic formos poetry which “wallrs
highest but not iiies.'' Hegel, in his luminous classifrcation
oi the-various kinds ol¹ poetry, has perhaps somewhat too
sharply drawn the line between its several degrees oi rank3
yet every one acquainted with the rudimentary principles oi
criticism must acknowledge, that just as it requires a larger
combination of very rare gists to write an epic or a drama
which the judgment ol ages allows to be really great, than
to write a lyrical poem, so it demands a much finer combi-
nation of some os the rarest oi those rare gihs to write a
lyrical poem which becomes the song of all times and na-
tions, than to write a brilliant sarcasm upon human infirmi-
ties‚ or an elegant lecture in the style oi an Epistle. These
last required but talents, however great, which are more or
less within the province oi prose-writers. The novel oi
. “ Gil Blas'’ or the Essays os Montaigne evince qualities oi
genius equal at least to those displayed in Horace's Satires
and Epistles. But ii you were to multiply Le Sages and
Montaignes od irpinitum, they could not accomplish a single
one ol Horace's nobler odes.¹ ¹

Now, the first thing that strikes us 'in examining the
secrets ol Horace’s art in lyrical poetry—and which 1 ven-
ture humbly to think it would be well ior modern lyrists to
stutly-is his terseness. Terseness is one ol the surest
