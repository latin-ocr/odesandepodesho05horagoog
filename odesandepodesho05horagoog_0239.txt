IN HONOR OF Bacchus,

. Macleane appears to me greatly to underrate the beauty oi
this poem, in which he says the Greek fire is wanting. This
is not the opinion of the earlier critics, nor os readers in
general. It has as much 'oi the character oi the dithyramb
as the testeos a Roman audience would sanction and the
character ol' the Latin language allow. The date os the'

poern
Amid sequestered rocky glens,-·ye iuture times believe
1 -
⁸ Bacciiris I saw, in mystic verse his pupil nymphs instruct-
rn -
gInstructing prickid ears intent
Of circling goat-heofed Satyrs.

OEvoh, with the recent awe is trembling yet my spirit,
Filled with the god, my breast still heaves beneath the '
stormy rapture.
OEvohl spare me 3 Liber, spare,
Dread with the solemn thyrsus!

Vouchsal'ed to me the glorious right to chant the head·
strong Thyads,

The wine that t'rom the iountain welled, the rills with milk '

o’erflowing,
And,srom the trunlrs oi channod trees,
The lapse os golden honey.

Vouchsal'ed to· sing thy consort's crown which adds astar to
heaven*

ἡ Or that just wrath which overwhelmed the house of Theben

Pentheus,
