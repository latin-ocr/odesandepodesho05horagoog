474 The Epodes os Horace.

Remorseless crone, loud gnrnting o’er the toil,

With her fell spade the yawning death-pit hollows,
Wherein they bury the yet living'child,

And twice and thrice each long day moclr his famine*
Chindeep (as waters on their brim suspend

The swimnrer) plunged, lingering he lives in dying,
To gaze upon the fond denied his line,

Till the parched liver and the shrivelled marrow
Shall into philters for vile love consume,

When once, yet staring on the food forbidden,
The glazing eyeballs waste themselves away.

If idle Naples and each neighboring city
Righrly believe, the Ariminian hag,

Unnatural Folia, sailed not that grim conclave,
She who could draw the moon and subject stars,

With her Thessalian witch-song, down from heaven.

To them, with thumbnail pressed to livid tooth,

Which gnawed and nrumbled it, spake dire Canidia.
What said she, or what horror left untold?

“ lle of my deeds sure arbiters and faithful,
Ο NightO Hecate, who o’er silence reign

In darksorne hours to rites mysterious sacred,
Now, now be present ς now on hostile homes

Turn wrath involred, and demon power revengeful
Now, while arnid the horror-breathing woods

Lurk the wild beasts, couched languid in soll slumber,
Dogs of Subura,† up l bark loud ; letali

Moelr the old lecher, with'a nard anointed

0 “Longo die bis terque mutate dapis
lnenrori spectaculo.”

‘⁴ [ongo ’' belongs to “die’‘ and not to '⁴ spectaculo'’ ‘¹ lnemori ” is not
found anywhere else; the ordinary form is “ immid-Macrum

f ‘⁸ Subura,” one of the most populous and one of the most profligate
streete of Rome. Canidia prays that the barking of the dogs may rouse
the street to nroclr the old man, skulking to other mistressoe than herself,
