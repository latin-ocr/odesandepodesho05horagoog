Per hoc inane purpurae decus precor,l
Per improbaturum haec Jovern,

Quid ut noverca me intueris, aut uti
Petita ferro belua ?’'

Ut haec trernenti questus ore constitit
Insignibus raptis puer,

Impube corpus, quale posset impia
Mollire Thracum pectora3

Canidia, brevibus implicata viperis
Crines et incomptum caput,

Jubet sepulcris caprificos erutas,†
Jubet cupressus funebres,

Et uncta turpis ova ranae sanguine
Plumamque nocturnae strigis,

Herbasqu'e, quas Iolcos atque Hiberiat
Mittit venenorum ferax,

Et ossa ab ore rapta jejunae canis,§
Flammis aduri Colchicisl

At expedita Sagana, per totam domum
Spargens Avernales aquas‚ll

Horret capillis ut marinus asperis
Echinus, aut currens aper.

witches are not hunred as luel in the magle (Colchian) flames, but are

boiled as materiale for the philter, os which the marrow and liner ol the
unhappy child are the completing ingredients.
