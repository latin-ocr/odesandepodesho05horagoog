172 Tic Odes of Horace.

While thy fortune, and youth* and the wool
Ol the Three Fatal Sisters allow.

Woodlands dearly amassed† round the horne proudly builded‚
Stately villa with walls laved by Tiber’s dun waters,

Thou rnust quit ; and the wealth piled on high
Ι Shall become the delight oi thine heir.

For no victim has death either preference or pity,
Be thy race from the king who first reigned o’er the Argive‚
Or thy father a beggm, thy roof
Yonder sky,-’tis the same to the Grave.

Driven all to that sold 5ss in one fatal urn shaken,
Soon or late must leap sorth the sure lot sor an exile

In the dark passage-boat which comes back
To the sweet native land never more.

* “Erae'' which Acron translates “youth'' an interpretation ap

’ proved by Eetre and Macleane. It more accurately, however, means “the

tirne oi lise,’' including every period before thatin which old age dead·
ens the sense ol such holiday enjoyments. Dellius was not young at the
date ol this poem; but, at years rnore advenced, M. Antony was young
enough to enjoy the present hour rather too much.

⁴ †“Codmptis saltibus.” ‘⁴ Bought up,” ‘¹ extensive properties added
together.'¹-llorvor.

Γ· Cogimur.” “Gregis instar compellimur ''—“ we are driven like

eheep.''-Onh:u.1.
