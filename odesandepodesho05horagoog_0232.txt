⁴⁴ Vita dum superest bene est ε
Hanc mihi vel acuta
Si sedeam cruce susune’*
Il this sentiment was sincerely expressed, the pathos ol the
poem is increascd. A man so dreading death may well
desire a compauion in the last Journey. Audit is not un·
lilrely that the melancholy view which Horace habitually
takes of the next world, and his exhortations to make the

best os this one, may¹ have been colored, perhaps insensi- v
bly to himself, by his conversations and intercourse with '‘

Maecenas.
Canu. XVII.

Cur me querelis exanimas tuis?

Nec dis amicum est nec mihi te prins
obire, Maecenas‚ mearum '

Grande decus columenque rerum

Ah! te mee si partem animae rapit

Maturior vis, quid moror altera,
Nec carus aeque nec superstes
Integer? llle dies utramque

Ducet ruinam. Non ego perfidum
Dixi sacramentum: ibimus, ibimuS,
Utcunque praecedes, supremum
Carpere iter comites parati.

⁸ The fragment is thus VQQ rendered into English hy llr. Far·
rarin the biographieal essay on encta, which forms the larger portion

ol his impressive and eloquent work, ‘⁸ The Seekers alter God :''-

‘¹ N umb my hands with palsy,
Rack my leet with gout,
Hunch my back and shoulder,
Let my leeth tall out; ,l
Stin, il lise be mmcd,
l preler the loss-
, Save my lise and gire mc
Anguish on the eroes*
