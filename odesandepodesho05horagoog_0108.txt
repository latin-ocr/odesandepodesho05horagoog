titious. Horace, no doubt, in his youth wrote a great
many satirical or vituperative poems which he had too
good taste to republish, and which, happily sor his fame,
have perished altogether. To some lady so libelled we
may well suppose this ode to have been addressed‚ tor it
has an air of reality about it. It may have been suggested
by the poem in which Stesichorus recanted his slanders on
Helen, but to what extent Horace here imitates that poem,

there are uo means oljudging.-

Curru. XVI,

0 matre pulchra filia pulchrior,
Quem criminosis cunque voles modum
Ponis iambis, sive flamma
Sive mari libet Hadriano.

Non Dindymene, non adytis quatit
Mentem sacerdotum incola Pythius,
Non Liber aeque, non acuta
Sic geminant Corybantes aera,

Tristes ut irae, quas neque Noricus
Deterret ensis, nec mare naufragum,
Nec saevus ignis, nec tremendo
Juppiter ipse ruens tumultu.

Fertur Prometheus, addere principi
Limo coactus particulam undique
Desectam, et insani leonis
Vim stomacho apposuisse nostro.

Irae Thyesten exitio gravi
Stravere, et altis urbibus ultimae
Stetere causae, cur perirent
Funditus, imprimeretque muris
