278 W Odes os Horace.

Not from such parents sprang that race undaunted‚
Who reddened ocean with the gore of Carthage,
Beat down stout Pyrrhus, great Antiochus,
And broke the might of direfrd Hannibal.'

Tnat manly race was born ns warriors rustic,
· Tutored to cleave with Sabine spades the furrow,
And, at some rigid mothers bluff command,
Shouldering the logs their lusty right hands herred,

Wh‘at time dre sun reversed the mountain shadows,
And from the yoke released the wearied oren,
As his own chariot slowly passed away,

Leaving on earth the friendly hour of rest.

What does time dwarf not and defonn, corrupting!
Our fathers' age ignobler than our grandsires'
Bore us yet more depraved· ; and we in turn
Shall leave a race more vicious than ourselves '
