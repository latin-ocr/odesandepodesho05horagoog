Book lle-Ode XI. 427

Telephus is altogether apoetic fiction ς neither amI satis
fied with the grounds upon which Ritter identifies the
Telephus oi Ode xiii. Book Ι., and xire Book ΙΙΙ., with
Heliodorus, the grammarian and Greek scholar mentioned
Serm. i. 5, 2, and assumes that another person is designated
under that name in this ode. Nothing is more likely than

that among Horace’s gayer companions there was some one ⁹
¹ very good-looking gallant, celebrated for his donnes ,mannes
among the freedwomen ol Rome, whom the poet always
designates under the name ol Telephus. It is observable
that there is considerable consistency in the way in which
Telephus is mentioned in Horace, with agoodbumored,
· hals-envious admiration lor personal gitis, and whom, on the
single occasion (Carm. xix. Lib. 111.) in which me hand·
some gentleman seems disposed to bore with an unseason-
able display os learning, he puts back into his right place
as reveller and gallant, with a certain superiority, such as,
when it came to a display of leaming,a Horace might be
disposed to assume towards a Telephus.

CARM. XI.

Est mihi nonum superantis annum

Plenus Albani cadus 3 estin horte,

Phylli, nectendis apium coronis;
Est hederae vis

Multa, qua crines religata fulges ; .
Ridet argento domus; ara castis
Vincta verbenis avet immolato

Spargier agno,

Cuncta festinat manus, huc et illuc
Cursitant mixtae pueris puellae;
