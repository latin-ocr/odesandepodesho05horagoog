102 T he odes os Horace.

· Here, within the deep vale, thou shalt shun the red dog-star,

And shalt sing us that tale on the Inte-strings of Teos,
How Penelope vied with the Sea's

Crystal Circe, for one human beart 3

sasely here shalt thou quaff, under cool leafy shadows,
Sober cups from the innocent vineyards of Lesbos3
'Tis not here that gay Semele's son*
Shall with Mars his encounters consound 3

Dread not here lest pert Cyrus, suspecting thee vilely,
Lay rash hands on that form not a match for rude anger,
Rend the garland which clings to thy hair, ·

O'r the robe-which deserves no such wrong.

‘¹ Bacchus.
