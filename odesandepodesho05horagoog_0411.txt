400 The odes of Horace.

Through loss, through· vounds, receives
Nevv gain, new life—yea, from the very steel:

“Not liercer did the Hydra hevn, regrow
Against Alcides, chased to be o'ercome3
Nor dagon-tecm, earth-soon
In Thebes or Colchis, spring to anndd men 3

“Merged in 1110 deeps, more fair comes forth its star ι’
Wrestle and vin, it bears the winner down ;
And widowed wives shall tell
Of vietors vanquished on the lields it foughtr

“No more to Carthage shall I send proud news3
Dies, dies the power, the fortune, the renovn
Of the great Punic name,
Dies hope itselffor Hasdrubal is slain.t

“There's nought the hands of men from Claudius sprung
Shall not achieve‚ with Jove their guardian god,
Th10ugh the sharp stress of war
Sped by the providence of heedful cares''

⁵ ‘⁴ Evenit.” Orelli, following Jhan, has “exiit '’-a reading unsanc-
tioned by more recent editors

1 “ Proelia conjugibus loquenda” Orelli considers that the line refers
to the Roman wives speaking with exultation ol the vars waged by their
husbanda Ritter, on the other hand, powerfully supporta the interpre-
tation of Mitscherlich-ria, that the line refers to the widows 01 the
slain. His argument seems to rne convincing.

1 Torrentius considers that here ends the speech attributed to Han·
nibal, and that 10 the last verse Horace speaks in his own person—an
opinion which has had many followers, and is defended by Ritter.
Orelli, supported by Madeane and Yonge, on the other hand, contende
that the speech 01 Hannibal is continued to the close 01 the ode-firstly,
because 11 is rno're complimentary to the Neros that 111011 praise and
predicted renovrn should corne from the mouth of their loe; secondly,
because it is more poetica] 10 conclude the poem with the prophecy 01
Hannibal, and more in the spirit of Pindar, as Olymp. 4, and Nem. 4
Munro gives his authority to this reading.
