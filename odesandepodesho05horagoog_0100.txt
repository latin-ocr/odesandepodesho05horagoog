S. Pompeius, and place on record his own vindication
ior refusing to put forth in so shattcred a vessel, and rest·
ing in port—i. e, with the government established under
Augustus.

The other supposition most favored asto the date of
the poem is that which places it in the year before the battle
os Actium, when M. Antony and Augustus were making
their preparations for war. This does not seem so prob
able a date as the other. The images of the poem would
ill accord with it. Horace could scarcely have said then
that the ship under Augustus was disabled, destitute oi row-
ers and chieis, and could not last through a storm3 and asin
that war Caesar went forth against Antony rather than Antony
against Caesar, the expostulation to keep in port would have
been very ill received by Augustus, and very contrary to the
spirit with which Horace always speaks oi that war and its
results, and to the willingness expressed in Epode i. to have
taken a share in the enteiprise, had Maecenas been appointed
to command in it. At the outbreak os the war with Antony,
Horace was a decided partisan of the established govem·
ment, and this poem is evidently written by a man who has
affection and sear sor those about to hazard some new enter·
prise against the existent order of things. He certainly
would not have addressed that warning to Antony's support·
ers. Whether the poem allegorizes the entire Republic, or
that party belonging to it with which Horace had been so
intimately connected, and with whose renewed hazards he
declined to associate himself, does not, however, very mate
n’ally signiiy; for a writer who has been a strong party-man
generally has his party in his mind whenever he proposes to
address the State. But if Horace really designed the alle-
gory for his old comrades under Brutus, about to cast their

' fortunas with Sextus Pompeius, he could not more affection-

ately part from them, nor more delicately imply his own ra· ·
tional excuses lor doing so,
