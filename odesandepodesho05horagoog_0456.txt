 

Book I K-Ode X V. 445

wished to sing oi those vars, Phoebus ehecked him. But
Phoebus doesonot forbid him to sing the triumphs oi peace;
and, with a lively lyrieal abruptness. he therefore at once
bursts forth :-

¹⁸ Tua, Caesar, aetas
Fruges et egris retulit uberes‚” etc.

That the poem was composed immediately alter the return
oi Caesar, and in connection with Odes iv. and xiv.,is,1
think, made clear by its own internal evidence. War is
finished, and Augustus is celebrated as the triumphant es·
tablisher oi law and order, and the author nithe national
prosperity, and the improvements, social and moral, which
result from the security to lise and property bestowed by a
govemment at once firm and beneficent. He is here the
descendant, not ol Mars and Ilia, but of Anchises and Venus
the gentle.

Canu. XV.

Phoebus volentem proelia me loqui
Victas et urbes, increpuit lyra;
Ne parva Tyrrhenum per aequor
Vela darem. Tua, Caesar, aetas

Fruges et agris retulit uberes,

Et signa nostro restituit Jovi,
Derepta Parthorum superbis
Postibus, et vacuum duellis

Jauum Quirini clausit, et ordinem
Rectum evaganti irena Licentiae
Injecit, emovitque culpas?
Et veteres revocavit artes,†
