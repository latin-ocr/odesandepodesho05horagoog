xii ¹ The odas of Horace.

lessed statesmen and political thinkers os the time-the Pol-
lios and the Messalas, the most eminent partisans os M. An-

In what 1 am about to say on his head,I confine my re·
marks to the short lyrical pieces to which commentators aster
his time gave the name ol Odes, and on which his eminence
