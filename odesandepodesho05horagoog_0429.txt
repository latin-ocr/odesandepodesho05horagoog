418 Tlre odes cffHorace. .

Though son ol' Mars and Ilia, what-had silence
Been his worth’s cold obstruction—Romulus?

The genius, favor, voice of powerful poets

Consecrate AEacus, from waves of Styx
Ravished to golden isles* The Muse permits not
The mortal worthy of her praise to die 3
Him the Muse hallows to the bliss of heaven.
Thus in the longed-for banquet-hall of Jove
Sits resolute Hercules3 the sons of Leda
Thus-one twin-star-from Ocean’s nether deep
Snatch tempest·shattered barks; and thus doth Liber,
His brows adorned with the vine's lusty green,
Hear as a god our mortal supplicatione,
And guide the votive prayer to happy ends.

four lines each, while this ode wants at present two verses necessary to

establish that rule. But, as Macleane observes, “the rule itself is arbi· -

trary, and a precarious foundation for such an assumption as the loss of
tvo verses, of which no traces are to be found in the oldest MSS and
commentators” Macleane thinks “that the confusion is easily seen
through by, those who avoid the commentatore and judge for thern·
selves. . . . When Horace says that the defeat of Hannibal by the
elder Scipio, and the destruction of Carthage hythe younger, do not hold
up their name more nobly than the Muse of Calabria-who does not
supply, in his own mind, ‘which was employed in doing honor to the
etderr’” To me the meaning seems clear enough Just as Horace,
Lib 1, Carnu xii. v. 4⁶, makes the name ol Marcellus, who took Syra·
cuse, stand for all his family, and include the young Marcellus, so he here
makes the name of Africanus stand for the whole family, and include
especially the younger Scipio. Or, as Ritter expresses it, the fame of the
elder Scipio, recorded by Ennius, was revived in the destruction of Car·
thage by the younger.
θ “Virtus et.favor et lingua potentium
Vatum divitibus consecrat insulis”

‘¹‘Virtus et favor' are generally taken like ‘lingua’ as belonging to
‘potentium vatunu’ so that ‘virtus' is ‘vis ingenii, facultas poetice) 1
doubt the accuracy of that interpretation; 1 think it rather means that
though AEacus vas virtuous (and he was much celebrated for his justice),
his virtue would not have raised him to the slries but for the applause
von him by the poets The causes, therefore, are, his virtue and the
public esteem (⁸ favor '), and the poet's praise that made his virtue lrnowrr.”
