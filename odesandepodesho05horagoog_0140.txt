Book I—Ode XXVIII. · 129

ral, if recent, assent with scholars than any other hypothesis
-and, aner much consideration,1 have adopted it iu my
version. Is the poem is, however, to be considered a dia-
logue,1 should not agree with Macleane in placing the
division at verse 15,* but at verse ao-“ Me quoque de-
vexi,'' etc. The very abrupmess ol the interposition ol the
¹ghost at that line, which has been considered by many
critics obJectionably harsh, appears to me a special merit.
Τὴε ghost, 'commencing his appeal at that verse, goes at
once to the purpose. He, being dead, has no need to say
that all must die; but, contenting himself with brieily in-
sorming the voyager that he has been drowned, hastens to
implore the handfuls oi dust which suffice ior burial. That
'it is not Archytas himself who speaks, whether in monologue
or dialogue,is,1 think, made periectly apparent by the sec·
ond and third verses of the ode-

“ Mensorem cohibent, Archyta,

Pulveris exigui prope litus parva Matinum

Munera,”
which I agree ‚with Macleane in con'sidering clearly to in-
timate that the body of Archytas has already received that
which he is supposed so eamestly to pray sor. “ For,’' thus
continues this judicious scholar, “though many, I am avare,
get over this difficulty by supposing ‘cohibent munera' to

seem to settle that question. Archytas, if commencing at line 16,

could scarcely appeal to the sailor as ajudge oi the learning oi Pythag· ·

ior ‘⁴ te judice‚’' is nowadays rejected by rational commentatore, who
rightly oppose unauthorized anrendments of texts supported by the con·
currence oi MSS.
