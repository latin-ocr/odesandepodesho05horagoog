96 T hc Odes of Horace.

ODE XVI.

RECANTATION.

There is no ground for sale conjecture as to the person
here addressed. The old inscriptions applying it to Tyn·
..9 daris, the daughter os Gratidia, celebrated as Canidia in
the Epodes, or the assertion in Cruquius that it is Grati-
dia herself, are now generally considered to he purely fic·
titious.

O, of mother so sair thou the yet lairer daughter,

To such end as thou wilt put my guilty iambics,

Fling them into 'the flames to consume,
Or the ocean of Hadria to drown.

Phrygian Cybele, no, nor the Pythian Apollo
In the innermost shrines soulconvulsing his priesthood,

No, nor Liber, nor Corybante mad
When their cymhals redouble the clash,

Craze the mind like the woeiul disorders ol anger,
Which are scared from their vent, nor by Norican salchion,
Wreckful oceane-untamable fires,
Nor ev'n Jove though himself thunder down.

. Itis said that Prometheus to man’s primal matter
Was compelled to add something from each living creature,
And thus from the wild lion he took
Rabid virus to place in our' gall.

Anger shattered in ruins the House of Thyestes,
Anger stands forth the cause by which cities have perished,
And the ploughshare ol insolent hosts
Has passed over the site of their walls.
