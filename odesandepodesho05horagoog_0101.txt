90 Τ lu odes os Horace.

Ο ship, shall new waves drift thee back into ocean l
What wouldst thou? Malle last, 0, make fast sor the haven!
Ahl dost thou not see how thy sides
Are all naked ol even the rowers i*

And thy mast by the south wind in lury is shattered,
And loud groan thy mainyards, and scarce‚† without cables
Undergirding the keel, couldst thou strive
With the sway of the tyrannous waters.

And thy sails are not whole, and the gods thou wouldst call on
Once more in the stress os thy peril have left thee,
August Pontic pine,‡ though thou art,
of a forest illustrious the daughter,

All useless the race, and the name that thou vauntest;
Cautious sailors trust nought to the stern's painted colors.
Beware‚ Ο beware, lest thou owe
Buta moclr to the winds thou wouldst hazard

Thou, lately the cause of my wearisorne trouble,
Object now oi deep care and regretlul affection,
Mark well where the Cyclades shine,
And avoid the waves flowing between thern.
