ODE VI.

TO SEPTIMIUS.

It is a reasonable conjecture, though nothing more, that
this is the same Septimius whom Horace introduces to
Tiberius, Epp., 1. iic, and whom Augustus mentions in aletter
to Horace, preserved in the lise attributed to Suetonius.

The scholiast in Cruquius says that he was a Roman knight,
and

To the ,world’s end thou’dst go with me, Septimius,
⁹ View tribes Cantabrian, sor our yoke too savage 3
And barbarous Syrtes, where the Moorish billow

Whirls, ever-seething3

No, my Septimius, may mine age close calmly

ln that mild Tibur by the Argive founded 3

There, tired of ranging lands and sens, and warsare,
Reach my last limit

Or if such haven the hard Fates deny me,
Thee will 1 seek, Galaesus gentle river,

· Dear to flocks skincladj* and thy rural kingdom,
Spartan Phalanthus.†

gOut of all earth most smiles to me that corner,
θ’ Where the balmed honey yields not to Hymettus,
Where olives vie with those whose silvery verdure
Giaddens Venafrum3

' ⁸ “Pellitis ovibus” “Pellitis”is supposed by Orelli and others to ·
refer turbe hides with which the fleeces oi the sheep were protected
from thorus and brambies and atmospheric changes.
† Tarentum, os which Phalanthos, the leader of the emigrant Parthe-
niae, aiter the first Messeniam war, gut possession.
