Book lla—Ode XVIII. 319

Canu. XVIII.

Faune, Nympharum fugientum amator,
Per meos fines et aprica rura
Lenis incedas abeasque parvis

AEquus alumnis;

Si tener pleno cadit haedus anno,

Larga nec desunt Veneris sodali

Vina craterae. Vetus ara multo
Fumat odore*

Ludit herboso pecus omne campo,
Cum tibi Nonae redeunt Decembres;
Festus in pratis vacat otioso

Cum bove pagus3

Inter audaces lupus errat agnos;

Spargit agrestes tibi silva frondes ;

Gaudet invisam pepulisse fossor -
Ter pede terram.†

with a comma at ‘craterae,’ and a period at ‘odore' Horace claims the
protection oi Faunus sor his lambe in the spring on the ground oi his
due observance os the rights oi December, which he then goes on to
describe. ‘Pleno anno’ means at the end oi the year when the Faunalia
toolr place” Theresore the division in the poem at which, aller the in·
vitation to Faunus in the spring, Horace passes on to describe the sesti·
wal in the winter, is more intelligible, and far less abrupt‚ by commencing
it with the sacrifice on the altar.
i “Gaudet invisam pepulisse fossor
Ter pede terram.”

. “‘Fossor'is put generally, I imagine, ior a laboring husbandman, who
may be supposed to have no love lor the earth that he digs ior another.’‘

to the anapaest, where two ieet are short and one long. Macleane quotes ·
Sir John Davles’s poem (Orchestra) in explanation ol this measure-
“And :riu their teet an anapat do aound,’' ete.

But it is perhaps best understood by any one who happens to have
learned, in the oldiashioned bompipe, that step farniliarly called “toe,
heel, and cloe,”-touching the ground ligbtly with the toe, next with
the hcel, and then bringing down the whole sole os the Ioot with a stamp.
1 have seen that step, or something very like it, perionned in a village
dance in the south oi Italy.
