ODE XV.
rue rnorurcr or nereus

This ode is considered by critics to bear the stamp oi
an early composition. It has certainly the vigor and fire
ol
When the salse Shepherd bore through the waters
Iu Idaean ships, Helen his hostess,
Nereus buried swill winds in loathed slumber
That Fate’s fell decrees he'rnight sing. '

“ Woe the day that thou lead'st to thy dwelling
Her whom Greece shall ask back by great armies,
⁴ Sworn in league to dissolve, with thy nuptiale,
The ancient dominion ol Troy.

‘¹ Ah! what death-sweat to war-horse and warrior!

Ahl what funerals that move with thy rowers

Bring'st thou horne to the race os the Dardanl
Already stern Pallas prepares

“ Helm, and aegis, and chariot and iury3

Vainly, bold in the saseguard ol Venus,

Shalt thou trim thy sleelr loclrs and charm women
With songs set to chords—not ol war ,d

“Vainly shun in thy paramour’s chamberl
Pond'rous spears and the darts os the Cretan,

And the roaros the battle ; and Ajarr
So swill when he follows a loe;

“ Late, alas l dust shall yet smear thy love-tocke
Lo behind thee, thy race's destroyer,
Lo Ulysses l-lo Nestor l-Thee, Teucer,

Thee, Sthenelus skilled in the fight
