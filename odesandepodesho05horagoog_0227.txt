ODE XVI.

TO Portemus GROSPHUS.

According to the scholiast in Cnrquius, this Pompeius
Grosphus‚a Sicilian by origin, was nithe Equestrian order.
Cicero (in Cic. Verr. 11. iii. 23) speaks oi Eubulides Gros·.
phus Centuripinus, as a man oi eminent worth, noble birth,
andprincelywealth. Estrb conjectures thatthis Grosphusuas

made

For ease prays he who in the wide AEgaean

Stormseized, looks up on clouds that heap their darkness

O’er the lost moon, while dim the constellatione

Fade from the sailor.

Ease, still ior ease, sighs Thracia fierce in battle,
Still ior ease sighs the quivered Mede. Ah, Grosphus!
Nor gems nor purple, no, nor gold can buy it,

Ense is not venai.

Bribed by no king,* dispersed before no lictor,

Throng the wild tumults os a soul in trouble,

And the cares circling round a sleepless pillow,
Under ceiled fretwork.†

He lives ou little well who, ior all splendor,
Declts his plain board with some prized silver heirloom.‡
From him no greed oi gain, oi loss no terror,

Snatch the light slumbers.

. Why, briefly strong, with space in tirne thus bounded,
Launch we so many arrows into distance? ’

*“ Non enim gand '‘Germ” lrom a Persian word, means “the
iring’s treasury,” “the royal coffers.'’

†“Laqueata tecta,” “non totius domus sed cubiculorum et triclinia·
rum.”-Drttruaunora

1⁴¹ Paternum salinum ’¹ -’ “ the paterual or hereditary salt · cellar.''
