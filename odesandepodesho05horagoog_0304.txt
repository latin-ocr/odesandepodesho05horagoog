Book Ille-Ode X. ²93

Canu. X.

Extremum Tanain si biberes, Lyce,

Saevo nupta viro, me tamen asperas·

Porrectum ante sores objicere incolis
Plorares Aquilonibus.

Audis quo strepit janua, quo nemus

Inter pulchra satum tecta* remugiat

Ventis, et positas ut glaciet nives
Puro numine Juppiter? '

Ingratam Veneri pone superbiam,

Ne currente retro funis eat rota'r

Non te Penelopen difficilem procis
Tyrrhenus genuit parens.

O quamvis neque te munera, nec preces,
Nec tinctus viola pallor amantium,
Nec vir Pieria pellicess saucius

Curvat‚ supplicibus tuis

t “ Ne currente retro lunis eat rota” This line has been tortured to
many interpretations. ‘¹ Lest the wheel turn back and the rope with it,”
is Orelli's, accepted by Macleane, who observes, the metaphor in that
caseis taken stom a rope wound round a cylinder‚ which being allowed
to run back, the rope runs down, and the weight or thing attached goes
with it. “The rope may break and the wheel run back,” is the con·
struction Macleane gives in his argument to the ode.

t “Pieria pellice,’' Macedonian lady os pleasure-Onttmr, Rrrrnn
There is some humor as well as witin coupling “pellice'’ with an
epithet so suggestive oi an opposite idea.
