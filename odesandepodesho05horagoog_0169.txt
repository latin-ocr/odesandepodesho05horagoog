158 Τ modes eff Horace. ¹

Speeding on to transfix into true ‚tonus os terror
The visions which fumes Mareotic* engender‚
As falcon that swoops on the dove,
As hunter that chases the hare

On the snow plains of Haemus-from Italy plying
Rapid oars on her flight near and nearer comes Caesar,
To chain, as the gapeshow of Rome,
The sair fatal monster. Too great ·

For such end, she but sought by what death to desy it,
She recoiled from the sword with no womanlike shudder‚
She crowded no sail to sar shores
Where life might lurk safe and obscure.

Brave to gaze with calm look round herdesolate palace,
Strong to grasp with firm hand and provoke the heroe

se ents
That, nigre where she fixed them, her veihs
Might' best the black venom imbibe;

Bolder made in the death thus assured by stem purpose,
She begrudged to the savage Liburnians† their captive;
In no insolent triumph was drawn
Discrowned, the grand womanoueen

* ‘¹ Mentemque lymphatam Mareotico.” '‘ Lymphatam ’¹ denotes panio
or visionary terrors (“ lymphata somnia ⁹) ‘¹ Lympha ”,and ⁴¹ nympha':
as Macleane observes, are the same word. Nympholepsy was the mad·
ness ocoasioned by the sight of the nymph flashing up from the sountain,
scaring the traveher out ut his sensas ; and “lymphatus '‘ literally means
“driven mad by the giare os water.’' Horace ascribes this effect to the
fumes, or perhaps rather the sparlde, oi the Mareotic wine, produced on
the banks os Lake Mareotis, in the neighborhood os Alexandria.

† ⁴¹ liburnians,” light suist-sailing vessels, which constituted a chief
portion os Augustus’s fleet at Actium
