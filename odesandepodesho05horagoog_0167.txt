ODE XXXVII.

ΟΝ THE rau„ OF CLEOPATRA.

In this ode Horace conspicuously manifests his unri-
valled art oi combining terseness and completeness. The
animated rapidity with which the images succeed each
other does not render them less distinct The' three pic·
tures oi Cleopatra constitute the action oi a drama; her
insolent power with its Oriental surroundings,-her flight
and sali—her undaunted death, And while, with his in-
herent manliness oi sentiment, Horace compels admiration

’ ior

Drinlr, companions, the moment has corne for carousal,
And the soor is now free to strike earth in brislr mensures,
For Salian* feasts now may be decked
The couches os statues divine. -

Not before was it lawful from time-honored cellars
To draw forth into light the stored Caecuban juices,
*While ruin and death were prepared
For Rome, by the fell madding Queen‚

With her horde oi vile eunuchs and outcasts polluted‚
Fooled by hope, drunlr with sweets in the chalice os Fortune:
Soon sobered when slunk from the flames
That enveloped ber navies—one ship!

* The Salii were the priests oi Mars Gradivus, twelve in number.
Their habitual festival was in March, when they paraded the city in
their official robes, carrying with thern the twelve sacred shields of Mars,
which they struck with rods, lreeping time to the stroke by song and
dance. At the conclusion of the festival the Salii partoolr of a banquet,
proverbial sor its magnificence, in the temple os Mars. ¹⁴ Pulvinaria”
are the couches on which the statues were placed, as it the gods thern·
selues were banquetcrs
