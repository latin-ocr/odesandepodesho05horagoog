ODE XI.

TO LEUCONOE.

'Ibe desire to solve the doubts by which rnan is beset in

the present, will, perhaps, so long as the world lasts, give an, .

audience to those who pretend to divine the sutrrre; andos
all modes ot' divination, astrology has beennon time im·
memorial, the most imposing, because it arrogates the rank
of a seience, and asseris that it bases its predictions upon
deductione from a vast accumulation oi laets. Rome, of
course, abounded in astrologers, who called themselves Chal-

daeans,

Nay, Leuconoe, seelr not to iathom what death unto rne—
unto thee

(Lore forbidden) the gods rnay assign3 nor the schemes ol'
the Chaldee consultl

How much better it is to learn patience, and that which
shall be to endure! '

Whether Jove may vouchsate our existence more winters,
or this be the last,

Which now breaks Tuscan ocean in spray on the timeeaten
roclrs that oppose,

Be thou wise, strain thy wine, and cut down lengthened
¹ hope to the briei span ol lise.

While we talk, grudging Time will be gone, and a part of
ourselves be no more.

Seize today-ior the morrow it is in which thy belief should
be least

* “Nec Babylonios tentaris numeros ’'-i. a, the astrologieal calcula·
piens, or, in technical phrase, ‘¹ schemes‚” ior which the Chaldees were so
amous
