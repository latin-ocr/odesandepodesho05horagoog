ΙΝ PRAlSE Ol* DlANA Aut> APOLLO.

lt was supposed by Franke that this hymn was composed

Diana, when he dedicated a temple to Apollo on the Pala·

727,
Hymn ye the praise ol Diana, young maidens,
Hymn ye‚ Ο striplings, the uoshom Apollo,
And hymn ye Latona, so dear
To the father Supreme in Olympus.

Maidens, sing her who delights in the rivers,
And the glad locks on the hrow os the lorests
That nod over Algidus cold,
Verdant Cragus and dark Erymanthus*

Youths, sing of Tempe with emulous praises,
Delos, the sair native isle ol Apollo,
And sing of the shoulder adorned
With the quiret, and shell ol the Brother.†

Moved by your prayer, may the god in his mercy
Save, lrom war and from pest and from sumine,
Our people‚ and Caesar our prince,
And direct them on Persia and Britain.
