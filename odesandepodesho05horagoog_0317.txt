306 The Odes ofHorace.

ODE XIV.

“Composed at the close of the Cantabrian war, nuc
729, when Augustus's return was expected, or on his return
the following year.''-Mncnnnwrn

In noticing the critical animadversions on this ode “as
· unequal
Joy‚ O ye peoplel it was said that Caesar

Went forth like Hercules, in quest of laureis ·
Bought but by death ; now home srorn shores Hispanian

Comes he back victor.

Let her whose joy in her sole lord is centred*

Join, in thanksgivings due, the glad procession—

Join, with the sister ol our glorious chiellain—
Join with the mothers,

Chastely adorned by sacrificial fillets†—

Mothers ol children now no more imperilled ς

Youths and young ‚brides hush, at such tirne illomened‚
Each lighter whisper.

Truly to me this holiday is sacred,

And its bright sunshine chases cloudy troubles. ⁸

I sear nor open brawl nor stealthy murder‚‡
Caesar yet living l

Up, boy, and bring the perfnme and the gerlande,

And wine that to the Marsian war bears witness

Is one jar, baffling Spartacus the Rover,
Somewhere lurks hidden.§

¹· “Unico gaudens mulier marito.‘’ See Orelli's note on “unico'’
which some have interpreted in the sense oi ‘⁸ unique ” or ‘¹ peerless ;”
Dillenburger, as ‘⁸ dear ’³ or “ beloved.’'

† Worn by the Roman matrons to distinguish them lrorn lreed women

t · ‘¹ Nec tumultum,
Nec niori pervim metuarn.”

“Tumultum ’' here evidently means “intestine leud” or ‘⁸ popular out·
break ;’‘ ‘⁸ vim,” “assassination ¹' or “personal violence.” With Caesar
. is identified the prevalling security ol law.
