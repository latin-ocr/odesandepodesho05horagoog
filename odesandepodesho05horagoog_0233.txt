222 T lte Odes os Horace.

Me, no flames bursting forth srom the jaws of Chimaera,
Me, no Gyas once more ri'sing up hundredhanded,
Could dispart from thyseli—such the will
Os omnipotentJustice and Fare.

Whether Libra, or Scorpio with aspect* malignant,
In mine horoscope, ruled o'er the Houses of Danger,
Or moist Capricom, lord of the west ;
Itis strange how our stars have agreed.

Thee, thine own native Jupiter snatched from fell Satum,
And outshining his bearn, stayed the wings of the Parcae,
When the theatre hailed thee restored,
And the multitude thrice shouted joy.

Me the fall nithe tree would have brnined, had not Faunus,
To men born under Mercury‚ guardian benignant,
O’er my head stretched the saving right hand,
And made lighter the death-dealing blow.

Then surget not to render to Jove, the Preserver
Of a life so august, votive chapel and victims,
While I, to mine own sylvan god,
Offer grateful mine own humble lamb.

⁸ “Adspicit’' “aspectedss’ is still the technical term in use among
astrologers, according to whom the native star may be evilly aspected
in various ways. But “pars violentior‘· would apply to the hostile
influences affecting “the Lord oi life‚'’ chiefly found in the significa·
tions ol the 8th and rath House. By his allusion to Capricom, Horace

‚ clearly refers to his dangers by sea-“ Sicula unda.” To astrology (a

science then so much in iashion) Horace osten refers-sometimes with
scom, sometimes with a seeming credulity- always as a man who
ί knew very little about it. But where he speaks of it with scom, as in
addressing Leuconoe, Book 1. Ode xi, it is less to denounce astrol·
ogy itsell as an imposture, than to dissuade from all attempts to
divine the future-‘¹ better that the future should remain unknown
