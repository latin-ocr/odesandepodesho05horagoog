466 The Epodes ofHorace.

EPODE 1v.

neurus? AN omniur.

All the scholiasts agree in considering that the person
satirized in this ode was the freedman Menas, lieutenant to
Sextus Pompeius, who deserted to Augustus nuic 716.
Modern critics have objected to this assumption, and their
objections ure tersely summed up and answered by Mac

leane

As tow’rds the wolf the lamb’s inborn repugnance

Nature makes my antipathy to thee,
Thou on whose flanlr still burns the Iherian whipcord*
Thou on whose limbs still galis the bruise ol chains,

Strut as thou wilt in arrogance ol putee-pride,

Fortune can change not the man’s native breed

Mark, as along the Sacred weyt thou flauntest,

Puffing thy toga, twice three cubits widel-
Mark with what lrankness indignation loathes thee,
Seen in the looks ot' every passer-by ll
‘¹ He, by Triumvirs so inured to lashes,
As tired the public crier to proclaim,l

Now ploughs some thousand lat Falemian acres,

And wears the Appian Road out with his nags ;

⁸ ‘⁸ Ibericis funibus” These were cords made ol “spartum'‘ usually
said to be the Spanish broom It was made into topos, especially lor
shipe' rigging. “It may be added, in severos the theory which makes
Menas the hero, that the mention oi Spanish rope· seems'to imply that
the person had suffered on bonrd ship, ii not in the country itsell'. since,
as Pliny tells us, rupes ol spartum were especially used in ships; and the
only way to give point to the epithet is to suppose it had reference to
Spain itsell or to the lieet”-thmrrz.

† The Sacaed Way, leading to the Capitol, rges the serente lounge ol
the idlers.
