his use, and annened to the English translation for the con·
venient facilities of reference and comparison.

My objects in the task Ihave undertaken have compelled
me to add in some degree the labor of a critic to thoseof
a translator. The introductions prefixed and the notes
appended to the several odes are designed not only to serve
for readers unacquainted with the original, but to bring, in
aterse and convenient form, before such students of Horace
as may not have toiled through the many and often conflict-
ing commentariesof the best editors, the opinions of eminent
authorities upon difficolt or disputed questions of interpreta-
tion. In my notes will be seen the extent to which I am

. indebted not only to Dillenburger‚ Orelli, Ritter‚ but to our

own recent English editors, Macleane and Yonge-and, on
certain points of controverted interpretation, to Mr. Munro's
erudite and valuable introduction to the beautiful edition il-
lustrated from antique gems, by Mr. King.

The majority of critics concur in the doctrine that all the
Odes in Horace, differing in this respect from the Bpodes,
consist of stamas in four lines, as the Alcaic and Sapphie
do. This opinion has been ahly controverted by Ritter.
Munro declines either to affirm or deny it. But conformably '
to the general opinion, I have treated, and so translated, the
Odes as quatrains, with four exceptions, for which I subjoin
my reasons.

Odes i. Book I., xxrc Book 111, and viii. Book 1v.‚ are
in the same metre, and the only ones that are ; but Ode viii.
Book IV. consists of thirty-four lines, and can not therefore
be reduced toquatrain stanzas3 and the supposition that
two verses required for such subdivision have been lost-no
evidence of such loss appearing in the oldest MSS. or being

intimated by the early commentators-is a hazardous basis
on which to rest the theory that the poem must have been
originally composed in quatrain. It is also to be observed ·

that Ode i Book I. so little adapts itself to the division of
