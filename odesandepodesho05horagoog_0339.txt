ODE XXII.

vot‘tve tttscktmott ΤΟ ΒΙΑΝΑ.

Nothing more need be said of this ode than that it isone
oi the votive inscriptions common among the ancients, and
that a pinetree would be very fittingly dedicated to Diana
The attempts made to extract a story out of the occasion
and the offering are preposterous. That which is chiefly
noticeable in this and other poems by Horace, more or less
similar, is the rare and admirable meritos terseness The
⁴ poet has sufficient reliance on himself to be sure that, how-
ever briefly and simply he expresses himself on a subject to
which brevity and simplicity belong, his unmistakable mark
will appear on the work.

Guardian of mountain-peaks, and foresta-virgin,

Goddess triformed-who, thrice invoked, benignly

Dost hear young mothers in their hour oi travail,
And from death save them;

Thine be this plne which overhangs my villa,

To which each closing year shall be devoted

A youthiul boar, os sidelong thrusts indulging
Vain meditatione
