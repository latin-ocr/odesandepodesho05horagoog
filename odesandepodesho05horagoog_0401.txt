ΤΟ MELPOMENE.

The sweetness and dignity 01 this ode have been a theme
01 unqualified praise to the critics. It was evidently written
aller the Secular Hymn, which gave authority and sanction
to Horace's claim to be ‘⁴ Romanae fidicen lyrae.'’

Whom thou, Melpomene,

Hast once with still bright aspect marked at birth*
On him no isthmian toils

Shall shed the lustre 01 tn athlete's lame;

Him shall no fiery steed
Ratish to victory in Achaian car;
In him no warlike deeds
Shall, from the hill-top 01 the Capitol‚†

Show to a world's applause
The glorious image 01 a conquering chief,
· ll'ith Delian leaves adorned,
ll'ho crushed the swelling menaces 01 kings ;

Yet him shall streams that llow

Thmugh fertile Tibur, and the thick-grown looks
01 the green forest-kings,

Endow with lordship—in AEolian song.

hle have the sons 01 Rome,
Sotereign 01 cites, deigned to enrol amidst

The choir beloved 01 bards;
And now even Eum· bites with milder fang.
