4¹0 Tlu odes of Horace.

Pledged to AEneas by his solemn nod
Walls more auspicious

Tuneful Thalia’s sovereign melodist,
. Laving in Xanthian waves thy goldeo hair,
Support the honor ol' the Daunion Mose,
Beardless Agyieusl*

Phoebus on me bestowed the soul, on me
The art ol song, on me the poet’s name.

†0 noblest virgins, and O ye young sons
Os noble fathers,

Wards ol the Delian goddess, with her bow

Striking the flight of stags and lynxes still,

The Lesbianss measure tirned and tuned by me,
Guard unforgett'ul,

Chanting, with ritual due, Latona’s son,

And her who ltindles night with crescent beatri,

Prospers the harvests, and the slidiog months
Speeds in their circle.

Say, maid, then redderit “ In that hallowed year

Which did the secular feast-lignis reillume,

Song dear to gods Ι sang-song taught by him,
Horace the poet”

⁵ The name oi Agyieus seems here very appropriately involred, be-
cause Apollo takes that name from the Greeks, as presidiog over the
thoroughiares ol cities, “quasi viis propositus urbanis ;” and all the
streets oi Rome would have been alive with the festival and processions
connected with the Secular Hymn which the ode refers to.

i Herc Horace turns to the chorus ol the Secular Hymn. .

t “lesbium servate pedem, meique
Pollicis ictum.”
By “pollicis ictum ’¹ is meant the motion oi the thumb in marking the
rhytlun or time oi the song, not the striking ol the lyres
