xxviii Tha Odes os Horace.

ing ideas the combination oi witich constitutes trtussnr.
And as the general effect of these ideas is soothing, so their
prevalence in his verse has acharm οἱ repose similar to the

prevalence ol green in the tints ol natme: we greet the con-

pleasure even in its quiet monotony.

Perhaps in most writerswho have in a preeminent de
gree the gift ol charm, there is, indeed, a certain fondness
l'or some peculias train ol thought, the repetition ol' which
gains lathem the attraction os associatipn. We should be

remains os those poets which time has spared, we find evi·
