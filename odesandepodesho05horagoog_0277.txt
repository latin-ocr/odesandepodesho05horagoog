266 The Odes os Horace.

her name to be Pulla, “extra limina Pulire ;” in which case
the lines might be imitated thus :-

“ Me on the slope ol Brighton Downs,
Beyond the threshold oi nurse Downle.’'

The most recent and the most plausible conjecture will be
found in the presace to Mr. Yonge's edition, p. vi, “Altricis
extra limina villulae,” “beyond the precincts of my native
homestead.” Mr. Yonge suggests, p. vii, a yet bolder, but,
we think, a less acceptable emendation, “Nutricis extra
limina villicae,” observing, that the “villica’' was an impor-

manager sor every part oi the household arrangements.
The construction would then be, “beyond the threshold
ol my nurse the bailtfl's wile.'’ As the obscurity ol this

gratily all Horatian scholars by subjecting the following
communication from a very high authority :—“I can not see
any difficulty about the Apuliae and Apulo; the adjective
and substantive often differ in accent, as gillant and gallhnt.
. Horace claims Vultur as an Apulian mountain, 'but says
that he has strayed beyond its Apulian side ; just as a child
at Macugnaga might say that he had strayed on the ‘Pied-
montese Monte Moro‘ beyond the limits ol Piedmont.’'

which they were detained, married into barbarian samilies,
