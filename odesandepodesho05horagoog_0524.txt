Epodc XVII.

Volente Circa, membra t* tunc mens et sonus
Relapsus, atque notus in voltus honor.

Dedi satis superque poenarum tibi,

Amata nautis multum et institoribus't

Fugit juventas, et verecundus color

Reliquit ossa pelle amicta lurida 3

Tuis capillus albus est odoribus 3

Nullum ab labore me reclinat otium ;

Urget diem nox, et dies noctem, neque est
Levare tenta spiritu praecordia.‡

Ergo negatum vincor ut, credam miser,
Sabella pectus increpare carmina,

Caputque Marsa dissilire nenia

Quid amplius vis? Ο mare, Ο terra! ardeo,
Quantum neque atro delibutus Hercules
Nessi cruore, nec Sicana fervida

Virens in AEtna flamma;§ tu, donec cinis

Injuriosis aridus ventis ferar,

i ‘⁸ Nec Sicana fervida
Virens in AEtna flamma.”

1 take “virens '¹ to have the same signification here that it has Lib. IV.
Carm. xiiid, ¹⁴ Virentis doctae psallere Chiae”-i. e.. youthiul, blooming
or budding, in the spring oi life. “Virens flamma”may be compared
with Lucretius's “Flos llammae.” 1 agree, therefore, with Macleane,
who follows Lambinus and the scholiast in Croquius, in interpreting the
meaning to be “the flante, always fresh and renewing itselt',” and having
no more to do with the color of the fleme as of sulphurous green, which
is the supposition iavored by Orelli and Dillenburger, than it has in the
line quoted above, where it is certainly not meant to imply that Chia is
‘⁴ green” The emendation oi ‘⁴ lurens,” suggested by Bentley on inserior
MS. authority, and rejected by most recent commentatore, would substi-
tute a prosaic commonplace ior a poetic image
