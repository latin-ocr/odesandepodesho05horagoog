440 The Odes of Horace.

And the snort os his war-horse was heard
In the midst of the lightnings ol battle*

As when Aufidus, laving the kingdoms ol Daunus,
Bursts in wrath, and inform of the wild bull‚† his borders,
And prepares the dread deiuge he drives
O'er the fields that are rile witb the harvest,-

So in storm, through that barbarous array swept the Nero,
Mowing, soremost to hindmost, ranks serried in iron‚
Till a victor he stood, without loss,
On aground that was strewn with the soemen;

But he owed to thysell the resources, the counsels,
And the gods From the day that her gates and void palace‚
Suppliant Egypt threw open to thee,
Had thy reign reached its third happy lustre,

When, in crowning thy wish and completing thy glory,
F ortune ended the wars which her favor had prosperedt ⁵
And established in triumph the peace
Ol a world underneath thy dominion.

Thee the dauntless Cantabriam before never conquered3
Thee the Mede and the Indiam and Scyth, the wild Nomad,

Mark in wonder and awe, guardian shield
Oi Italia, and Rome the earth’s mistress.

Thee the Nile, unrevealing the source ol its waters;
Thee the Danube ; and thee the swift rush os the Tigris3

l “ Taurilormis Aufidus ;” literally, ¹⁴ tauriform” or “ buil-formed Au·
fidus.” The image is applied to many rivers by tbe Greek and Latin
poete. Madeane suggests that the branches osso many large streame at
the mouths οἱ rivers might have suggested the idea ol the homs3 but it
seems to me that the comparison to the bull in general applies to the
blind and seneeless violence of the animal, who runs on indiscriminately‚
