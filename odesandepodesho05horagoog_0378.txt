probably by Sulla, to iisteen (quindecimviri), were ordered
to consult those macies, and they reported that the time
was come to revive the old Tarentine games. They intro
duced, however, certain innovations, such as the cyclical
or secular period, ior their celebration (pretending that such
periods had been always observed, or at least enjoined),
and the substitution of Apollo and Diana sor Dis 3ηά
Proserpina. The latter change seems natural enough
Diana had among her attributes those ol Proserpina, and
Apollo was the deity whom Augustus especially honored
at his patron god. Dis and Proserpina were no longer
in fashion, and ‘were probably never very popular with the
genuine Romans 3 while, as the sestival was not designed,
like the old Tarentine games, lor the averting ,oi some
national calamity or mortal disease, but rather to attest the
blessings enjoyed under the Empire‚ and implore their 'con-
tinuance, the direct invocation of the infernal divinities
would have been very inappropriate ; and, indeed, their
powers as averters os evil had become transferred to Apollo
and Diana (as the sun and moon), who were also the be-
stowers ol good. Sacrifices were, however, offered to Dis
3ηά Proserpina on the first clay ol the ceremony among
other gods, in the list of whom they are placed last.
Still it may be seen iu the following Hymu that much of
the original character oi the Tarentine or Taurian games
was retained, however modified to suit altered circumstances.
Diana is especially implored to protect mothers and mature
their oiispring. Augustus approaches the altar with white
steers lor sacrifice, as cows bad been sacrificed to Dis in the
Taurian games (though, as black animals had been offered to
. the infernal deities in time os calamity, the white color of
the steers was significant ol the change to celestial divinities
and the felicity of the period), and* the games commenced
