200 The Odes of Horace.

ODE XI.
το Qururrus uterinus.

Who this Hirpinus was we do not know. Orelli considers
it probable that he is the Quintius to whom Ep. Ι. xvi. is ad·

dressed. But Macleane observes “that the latter appears
to have been younger than the former, whom Horace ad-

’ dresses (v. 15) as ii he werea contemporary.” But the ques-

tion is immaterial ; for we know uo more about the Quintius
of the Epistle than the Hirpinus os the Ode.

What the warlike Cantabrian or Scythian,
From ourselves by an ocean disparted,
Take it into their heads to devise,
Do not class with‘the questions that press.

Be not over-much anxiouS, Hirpinus,

For the things of a lise that needs little;
See how Beauty recedes from our side

With her beardless* twin playiellow Youth.

Grizzled Age, dry and sapless, comes chasing
Frolic Ioves and the balrn oi light Slumbers;
’ Not the same glory lasts to the flower,
Not the same glowing faceto the moon:

Why to fathom the counsels eternal
Strain the Mind without strength sor such labor?

Why not rather, yon plane-tree beneath,
Or this pine, fling us carelessly down,

While we may ; letting locks whiten under

Syrian nard and the fragrance of roses.
Drink Ι Euius dispels eating cares.

Hoi which of you, boys, will assuage
This Falernian in yon running waters?

Which eutice that sequestered jade, Lydo,†
With her iv'ry iute, and with her iocks,

Like a Spartan maid's, simply knit back.
