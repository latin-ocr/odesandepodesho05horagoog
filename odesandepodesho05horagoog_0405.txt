ODE IV.
iv annisa or pausus aun ras naeu or 'rus uanos.

When, nuc. 738-9, Augustus and Tiberius were in Trans
alpine Gaul, the fierce tribes of the Vindelici and Raeti (the
first occupying a considerable range ol country between the
Danube and Lake Constance. the last neighboring them to
the south, and extending to Lake Como) made sorays into
Italy and Cisalpine Gaul, attended with great cruelty and

brother os Tiberius, who was then in his twenty-third year.
He defeated and drove them from Italy. It is clearly in

honor-os the victory under Drusus that the ode is com· '

additional forces. Thus united, the two brothers reduced
these and other tribes-such as the Genauni and Breuni

Secunda). It was in honor of this completed conquest
and of the part which Tiberius had in it, that Ode xiv. was
composed, and, as may be reasonably supposed, somewhat
subsequently to Ode iv. The opening ol this poem is un·
usually
Even as the thunder’s wingdd minister-
To whom, proved true to Jove’s entrusted charge
In gold-haired Ganymede, = ,
Heaven's king gave kingdom over wandering birds-

Urged t'rom his eyrie by the goad os youth,
And pulses glowing with ancestral fite,
Leams from the winds of spring,
When gone the rain-clouds, timidly to soar,

Till on the sheepiold rushes down its soe 3
Next, bolder grown, the hungering greed not loss
