322 The Odes of Horace.

But the Gracc, with her twin naked sisters, shuns quarrel,
And to more than three measures refuses her sanction. ’
Hol hol what a joy to go mad ior a time!
Why on earth stops the breath ol that fise Berecyn-
thian?

And why is that harp so unsocially silent,

- And the lively Panddan pipe idly suspended?

Quick, roses-and morel Let it rain with the rosel
There is nothing 1 hate like the hand os a niggard.

Let the noise ‘oi our mirth split the ears of old Lycus.
He is envious-our riot shall gorge him with envy.
The ears of our neighbor, his wile, let it reach.
No wife could suit less the gray hairs of old Lycus*

Thee,O Telephus, radiant with locks of thick cluster.

, Thee‚ with face like the star of the eve at its clearest,

Budded Rhode is courting; I too am on fire, ,
But me Glycera keeps in the flames buming slowly.†

* The graduated process oi adrinking-bout ls most naturally simulated
in these verses. First stage, the amiable expansion ol heart in the
friendly toust—the toleration oi cliffering tast0s3-each man maydrink
as much as he likes Secondly, the consciousness ol getting drunk, and
thinking it a fine thing ;-Joy to go mad Thirdly, the crawing lor
noise ;-let the band strike up. Fourthly,a desire ior something cool;
——roses in ancient Rome-stanlhrl-glss lillhly,
the comburite stage ;-aggressiye insult to poor o yc Sixthly‚
the maudlin stage, soll and tender;-complimentary to Telephus, and
confidingly pathetic as t'o his own less fortunate love-affairs.

lCommentators have endeavored to create a puzale even here,
where the meaning appears very obvious. Rhode runs aster you (petit),
who are so handsome-Glycera does not run aller me, but keeps me
languishingpthe sense is consistent with the tone, hali enwioushall

sarcastic, with which the poet always speaks oi Telephus, the typicnl
beautyman and lacly-killer.
