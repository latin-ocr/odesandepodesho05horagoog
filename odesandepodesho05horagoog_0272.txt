Book rvr-ode JV. ’ 261

Vos Caesarem altum, militia simul
Fessas cohortes addidit oppidis*
Finire quaerentem labores, ·

Pierio recreatis antro.

Vos lene consilium et datis, et dato
Gaudetis, almae.† tScimus, ut impios
Titanas immanemque turmam '
Fulmine sustulerit caduco,

Qui terram inertem, qui mare temperat
Ventosum, et urbes regnaque tristia,
Divosque, mortalesque turbas
Imperio regit unus aequo.

Magnum illa terrorem intulerat Jovi
Fidens juventus horrida brachiis,
Fratresque tendentes opaco
Pelion imposuisse Olympo.

t Here Horace, starting from the picture of Augustus cultivating the
Muses, and taking from them humane counsels, proceeds with poetic ab·
ruptness to symbolize the victory ot' Augustus over the violent and irra-
tional forces hostile to the great social interests ol man. The reader
must not suppose (as some critics have inconsiderately done) that Horace
signities Augustus himselt'in the attributes he assigns to Jove. He would
very imperfectly understand Horace who could conceive him thus to
abase to the level ol an earthly vicegerent that supreme divinity, to whom
there is no likeness and no second Horace does hut imply that the
same Divine Powers who defeated the brute {orces ol the Titans and
giants were on the side ol Augustus in the civil vars.
