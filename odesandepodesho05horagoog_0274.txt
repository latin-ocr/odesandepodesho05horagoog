· Sed quid Typhoeus et validus Mimas
Aut quid minaci Porphyrion stata*
Quid Rhtatus, evulsisque truncis .
Enceladus jaculator audax,

Contra sonantem Palladis aegida
Possent ruentes? Hinc avidus stetit
Vulcanus, hinc matrona Juno, et
Nunquam humeris positurus arcum,

Qui rore puro Castaliae lavit
Crines solutos‚† qui Lyciae tenet
Dumeta, natalemque silvam,

Delius et Patareus Apollo.

Vis consili expers mole ruit sua:
Vim temperatam di quoque provehunt
In majus 3 idem odere vires
Omne nefas animo moventes.

Testis mearum centimanus Gyas
„ Sententiarum, notus et integrae
Tentator Orion Dianae,
Virginea domitus sagitta.

²¹¹9 battle, Horace means to say, that although they were present, it was
Pallas to whom the victory is mainly owing, otherwise the force of his
argument is lost.” But, as is said in the introduction, Horace appears
to me to have desired emphatically'‚ though symbolically‚ to intimate the
nature of the Powers that were ranged on the side of Pallas, ι’. e., in the
muse ol Augrrstus-Vulcan, the representative os industry-Juno‚ ol
social order and marriage-Apollo, of arts and letters. This supposi-
tion is in accordance with the social political objecta to which these odes
are devoted, and with the special benefits which Horace elsewhere as·
cribes to the reign of Augustus.
