54 Ι T he Odcs ofHorat‘e.

What the approach by which Death could have dauuted “
Him who with eyelids unmoistened beheld

Monster t'orms gliding and mountain waves swelling,
And the grim Thunder-erags dismally iamed?

Vainly by nastes οἰ dissociable ocean
Providence severed· the lands t'rom the lands

11' the plains not to be touched by our t'ootsall
Be, yet, profanely o’er·leapt by our rafts.

Rushes man’s race through the evils forbidden,
Lawlessly bold to brave all things and bear:
Lawlessty bold did the son of the Titan

Bring to tho nations sue won through a fraud.

· Fire stolen thus from the Dome Empyrhan,
Meagro Decay swooped at once on the earth,
Iaeagued with a new-levied army oi severs-
Death‚ until then the siowootnensaroff,

Hunied his stride, and stood sacing his victim 3
Daedaius, upward, the void reahns oi air

Sounded on wings that to man are not given;
Down, burst the labor Herculean through hell.

Nought is too high for the daring of monals 3
Heaven’s very sels in our ioHy we stonn.

Never is Jove, through our guilty aspiring‚¹
Suffered to lay down the bolt we provoke. ·
