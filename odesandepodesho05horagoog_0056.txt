And if the ivy crown may be won by pleading causes or
giving advice to cliente, it can be no inappropriate reward
to the brows os a statesman so accomplished as Maecenas.
Thus,I think, there is much to be said in favor oi the
construction-“Thee, Maecenas, the ivy wreath—prize ot
learned or skilled brotvs-associates with the higher gods
(i. e., with those who watch over states and empires) 3 me,
the·lovc of rural leisure and the dreams that it begets set Ι
apart from the crowd.'' On the other side, Ritter has the ,
best vindication 1 have seen os the alleged contradiction or
bathos in the Poet's boasted association, first, with the high-
er gods, and next, with the inferior deities. According to
him, Horace is speaking of two kinds oi lyric poetry—the
lofty and the spontive. The first, symbolized by the ivy, as·
sociates him with gods in heaven ; the second, connecting
him with the pastimes ot nymphs and satyrs, separates him ⁸
from the popular pursuits oi men. For the first, he trusts
to the aid os Polyhymnia, presiding over the Lesbian lyre
(oi Alcaeus) ; sor the second, to the livelier inspiration of
Euterpe.
