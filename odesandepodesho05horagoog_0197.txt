186 T ke Odes of Horace. Ι

Give to Jove, then, the feast that thou ow'st to his mercy3
Worn with warfare so lengthened rest under my laurel,
Nor will 1 allow thee to spare ,
The caslrs Ῑ have destined sor thee.

Ho, slaves, brim the eups‚* Egypt's eups smooth and wide-
li ed
With ξιξ solt Massic wine whioh lulis care in oblivion3
Pour sweets lrorn large shells. Who the first
F r'esh parsley or myrtle will twine? '

Whorn will Venus† belriend in the cast sor our wine-kingi- ,
As lor rne,1'm prepared to out-tipple a Thracian:
Ah, how sweet to drown reason in joy, ¹

For the friend whom 1 welcorne once more!

* “Ciboria,'’ cups shaped like the pod ol the Egyptian bean “Ore
superius lato, inferius angusto'’-0nr:1.u.

†“ Quem Venus arbitrum dicet bibendi.’' Venus was the highest
throw on the dice, Canis the lowest.
