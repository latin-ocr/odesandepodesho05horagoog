Epode XI V. 499

The beauiy who inflarnes Maecenas, so gracetutly mentioned
at the close ol the poem, is, according to the scholiasts‚ cer-
tainly Terentia, whom Maecenas was then either married to
or courting. And that assumption is generally adopted by
modern critics. Still it scarcely seems consistent with Ro,
man manners, or withUHorace’s good breeding and knowl-
edge ol the world, that he should imply a comparison be·
'tween his passing caprice l'or a public wauton, and the hon-
orable love ol a man oi the highest station to the lady he
had married, or was wooing in marriage.

Canu. XIV.

Mollis inertia cur tantam diffuderit imis
Oblivionem sensibus,

Pocula Lethaeos ut si ducentia somnos
Arente fauce traxerim,

Candide Maecenas,* occidis saepe rogando:
Deus, deus nam me vetat

Inceptos, olim promissum carmen, iambos

. Ad umbilicum adducere.†

Non aliter samio dicunt arsisse Bathyllo
Anacreonta Telum,

Qui persaepe cava testudine flevit amorem,
Non elaboratum ad pedem.

Uteris ipse miser: quodsi non pulchrior ignis
Accendit obsessam Ilion,

Gaude sorte tua3 me libertina, neque uno
Contenta, Phryne macerat.
