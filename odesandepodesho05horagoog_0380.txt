TheSeculor Hymn. 369

of such good sense and of such knowledge of the world as
Horace is allowed to have been. And it is not to the
Alcaic metre, but exclusively to the Sapphic, as connected
with his name, that he refers, Lib. IV. Carm. vi.
“Ego dis amicum
Saeculo festas referente luces,

Reddidi carmen, docilis modorum
Vatis Horati.”

Horace's boast, then, is only to be justified by the supposition
that although Catullus had preceded him in the adoption of
the Sapphic metre, he had not adapted it to song-had not
incorporated it in the popular form of lyrical music-and
Horace had done so, and been the first to do it.

I apprehend‚ therefore, that Horace's vaunted originality
consisted in being the ‚first by whom the borrowed metres
were set to Italian music-the first by whom, through arts
not before divulged, the words were to be united with
musical strings (“ Non ante volgatas per artes Verba loquor
socianda chordis''-Lib. IV. Carm. irc), and thus popularized
in banquet-halls and temples as national songs (Lib. 111.

Garmai). It seems to me that in this sense he says he is Ι

pointed out as ‘⁸ Romanae fidicen lyrae ” (Lib. IV. Carm. iii),
“ fidicen '’ being aword especially applicable to a musician,
and only metaphorically to a poet.

That several of the odes were not adapted to singing
does not invalidate this supposition. Such will be the case
with every copious lyrical poet, who may, nevertheless, like
Moore, have achieved his main popularity through the adapta-

' tion of his verse to musical accompaniment and national airs.

Whether the music to which the measures employed by
Horace were set was composed by himself in whole or in
part, or by others, is a question on which there are no data
for legitimate conjecture. Is by himself, one might suppose
that some record of the fact would be preserved by Sueto
nius or the scholiasts. On the other hand, if composed by
