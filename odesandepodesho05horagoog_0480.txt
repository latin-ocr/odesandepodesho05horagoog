' Epode V. 471

Canidia is resolved to charin back to her, that the philter is '
prepared, adds to the vileness which the poet ascribes to the·
hag. This epode was probably composed about the same
timeas the 8th Satire os the First Book, in which Canidia
and Sagana are represented secking the ghastly materials oi
Α their witchcraft, and invoking Hecate and Tisiphone in the

Esquilinian bonai-ground. The poem has little os the greces
of expression which characterize Horace’s maturer odes,
and in one or two passages the construction is'iaultily ob
scure, but the grandeur os dre whole conception, and the
vigor os the execution, need no comment, and compensate
sor all defects.

The scholiasts say that Canidia’s real name was Gratidio,
and that she was a Neapolitan perime-vender. That she
was ever a mistress of Horace's is a conjecture founded
upon no evidence, and nothing extant in Horace justifies
the assumption. This poem was written when Horace was
young, and he could scarcely have remembered, except in
his childhood, Canidia more lovely thau he invariably repre·
sents her.
