⁵ Itis pleasant to think that the modern law os whatis mlled ‘⁸ po
etic justice,’' has a precedent in the final restoration ol this young lady to
the arms ot the husband she had so merciiully spared. Probably she
was the ugly one os the family, and less likely, issue killed one husband,
to find another. Ovid's Epistle os Hypermnestra to Lynceus, supposed
to be wdtten while imprisoned by her father, is much indebted to Hor·
ace's lines. But perhaps both poets borrowed from a common souroo
which is lost to modern discoverers.
