ODE XXXI.

PRAYER ΤΟ APOLLO.

Aster the battle os Actium, Augustus, in commencing the ⁶
task ot social reformet, restored the ancient temptes and
built new ones. Amongst the latter, auc. 726, he dedicated
to Apollo a temple, with a library attached to it, on the
Palatine. This charrning poem expresses the poet’s private
supplication to the god thus newly installed.

What demands at Apollo’s new temple the poet?¹
For what pra'ys he outpouring new wine in libation?
Not fertile Sardinia’s rich sheaves,
Not sunny Calabria’s fair herds 3

Neither prays he sor gold, nor the ivory of Indus,
Nor the meadows whose margin the calm-flowing Liris
Eats into with murmurless wave.
Let those on whom Fortune bestows

So luxurious agrape, prune the vineffffees oi Cales,
And let trade’s weaithy magnate exchange sor the vintage
Spiced cargoes os Syria, and drain
Cups* sculptured for pontifis in gold ;

Dear, indeed, to the gods must be he who revisits
Twice and thrice every year the Atlantic, unpunished:
To me for a feast, mallows light,
And endives and olives suffice.

Give me health in myseis to enjoy the things granted,
O thou son of L'atona; sound mind in sound body;
Keep mine age free from all that degrades,
And let it not fail ot' the lyre.

· “Culullis‚''sculptured cups used by the pontiffs and Vestal virgins
in the sacred festivals
